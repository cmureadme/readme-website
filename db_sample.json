Under heavy fire from ed, students were ordered not to stress and to get sleep before the examination, however many found these to be impossible feats. \r\n\r\nThe scene was thus: exhausted students, desperately writing lines by hand, because although technology has progressed to the point that we currently have text generating large language models and at least partially functioning virtual reality headsets, the Carnegie Mellon University (home of AI) Intro to Programming course’s midterm is still on paper. Godspeed if you don’t have an eraser, or worse, a pen.\r\n\r\nThe evil genius of this exam is in its deception. Compared to the practice test, the midterm’s first few questions were a breeze. No weird syntax for copying lists or definitions of MVC. It was suspiciously easy, meant to lull the students into a false sense of security which was then ripped to shreds with the third free response question (of four). Many students would skip it intending to return and never to do so. \r\n\r\nScientists report that there was, in fact, a temporary phenomenon of time dilation where individuals within DH 2210 from 9-10:20am and 2-3:30pm on the day of the midterm did experience time speed up during the last third of the exam.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the exam came many questions between the sobs. “What will my parents say?”, “Who is responsible for this?”, “When was the 110 add deadline and is it too late to transfer to Pitt?”\r\n\r\nYour humble writer now resigns to return to Gates and continue running their code until they see the sacred words… *Passed sample test cases! Press 'Check' to run all test cases.*",

    "body": "Last Thursday, a trio of students attempting to raid the famed steam tunnels under Margaret Morrison Hall for treasure were caught by CMU police. While their possessions were being confiscated, however, CMUPD came across a far more disturbing secret. Dusting off the asbestos powder covering its surface, police officers were intrigued to discover what appeared to be a small whiteboard containing an answer to a programming assignment.\r\n\r\nAfter closer inspection, the homework problems were determined to be from the 15-122 class, Principles of Imperative Computation. Fearing the horrific consequences of what was to come, CMUPD immediately declared a state of emergency, closing off the entirety of Margaret Morrison Hall and assembling a wall of officers around the building until the CMU Dean of Student Affairs was able to arrive on the scene and call for an emergency session of the Faculty Senate. Following the review of the sacrilegious whiteboard, which was promptly determined to be an egregious Academic Integrity Violation, the CMU Student Affairs Department identified the smudged-out name on the whiteboard to be that of Jeremy P. Laceholder, a former student of CMU’s School of Computer Science.\r\n\r\n“It’s just a tragedy,” lamented CMU President Farnam Jahanian, wiping the tears off of his famously luscious locks of golden hair. “Here at CMU, we value the reputation of our degrees, and to find that one of our graduates has left an answer to a merge sort problem right underneath a student dormitory for everyone to see fills me with an incredible amount of shame,” he continued with a grim expression on his face. “The CMU community should rest assured that we will take care of this business in at least O(log n) time.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the CMU Academic Violation Board, Laceholder had sadly passed away in 2015 due to an unexplained respiratory illness, and was therefore unable to be held on trial. However, this didn’t stop the Board from choosing to revoke his degree, incinerating the guilty whiteboard, scratching his name out from the school records, and ultimately deciding to ban any remaining imitation of his physical likeness from entering CMU premises. “All’s well that ends well,” Jahanian remarked. “I’m glad that we could settle this matter reasonably and avoid having to take any drastic measures against the academic offender”, he said with a chuckle, before he was hurriedly escorted out of the building while discreetly whispering into his cell phone, “Iliano? Iliano, grab the shovels.”\r\n\r\nCMUPD officials were unfortunately unavailable for further comment due to an unexplained spread of respiratory illnesses among the officers.",

Anyways, here are the crimes!  \r\n\r\n**Student’s Mouse Problems Turns Ugly**\r\n\r\nRecently, two CMU students had been sued by the Mouse himself after selling charms and prints featuring a black anthropomorphic mouse character wearing gloves on campus grounds. When readme correspondence interviewed the two, they responded that the color and the gloves were the only similarities. In fact, their mouse wore a shirt and had whiskers unlike the Mouse himself. The Mouse is demanding $2.5 million in compensation and emotional damage. Only time will tell what happens to the case. \r\n\r\n**Hunting Head of Fake Licenses**\r\n\r\nA man was recently arrested for hunting sixteen doves within a day, one over the daily limit. Upon his arrest, it was revealed he had a fake hunting license. Several other men have been arrested who also had similarly fake licenses. With the wild turkey hunting season drawing close, the authorities are worried about who else is hunting game without the appropriate documentation. One CMU student noted that people will hunt illegally anyways. However, the authorities have said it is more so about the principal and taking advantage of the government. Now, the authorities are on the prowl for whoever is handing out these fake hunting licenses. \r\n\r\n**Carnivore War**\r\n\r\nAn all out war has shaken out on campus. Two factions of the Carnivore Chomping Club have split up in regards to what is and is not allowed in a carnivorous diet. One side are the carnivore purists, only eating meat and nothing else, while another side also indulges in seafood and animal products. The Fence and the pathways have become victims to the war with taunting messages written to the opposite faction as well as the general student population. Other club executives are frustrated with the Carnivore Chomping Club because of the lack of ability to advertise. However, the general public doesn't seem to care too much with it just being an inconvenience.",

Now I’m sure you’ve been told about some of the benefits; a great community, parties, hands on experience, parties, engineering experience, and parties. I’m here to tell you the real benefits of being a mechanic: waking up at 4 am. \r\n\r\nDo you have problems sleeping? Worry no more. After a few weeks of rolls, you’ll find you can sleep anywhere. Mechanics can be found snoozing on the back of pickup trucks and up against light poles!

Coffee consumption for buggy mechanics over the weekend is double that! Worried your heart isn’t beating? To be conscious during the day you’ll be consuming so much coffee you’ll never doubt it’s not working again!     \r\n\r\nWaking up at 4 am both days of the weekend for months at a time is very healthy, actually.

    "title": "CIA Buggy Mounts Another Coup in Guatemala",
    "body": "{{CIACoup.png}}\r\nLast Monday CIA forces entered Guatemala City to launch a week-long attack on the Guatemalan government, culminating in the ousting of President Bernardo Arévalo and the instatement of an authoritarian military dictatorship. According to leaked documents found in Stever basement, the campaign was a joint operation between CIA Buggy and Chiquita Brands International to further destabilize Guatemala and loosen agriculture restrictions harming US businesses. An anonymous pusher for Spirit has also stated that a new KGB chapter in Guatemala had been a motivating factor.\r\n\r\nNamed Operation PBBrag, the first buggies made landfall on the beaches of Puerto San José at approximately 3:45 AM. By 10:30, the first squadrons reached Guatemala City. Buggies were equipped with custom-made Chiquita branded turret guns built by Robobuggy. Although Operation PBBrag had intended to be largely peaceful, only using weapons as a display of force, the first gunshots rang out on Tuesday at 2:47 PM. The conflict quickly escalated into all-out war within the city streets. The Guatemalan Armed Forces were initially successful at repelling the CIA, however reinforcements from SDC and Fringe quickly turned the tide. The increased speed and sheer destructive power of the buggies, combined with the suicidal nature of the average Carnegie Mellon student, was ultimately too difficult for Guatemala to fend off.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harry Q. Bovik seized power over Guatemala on Friday at 7:28 AM. Over 300,000 were injured and 50,000 killed, with around 40% being civilians caught in the crossfire. A reputable source told READMe that CIA Buggy was looking into ways to employ their new weaponry during the Carnival races. Neither CIA Buggy nor Chiquita Brands International have responded to requests to comment from ReadMe. In completely unrelated news, CIA Buggy has recently received a $5,000,000 sponsorship from Chiquita.",

    "title": "The secret dark reality of ChatGPT",
    "body": "Much to the dismay of educators around the globe, the popularity of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has exploded over the past year. Millions of prompts are sent every day to OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot ChatGPT. Carnegie Mellon’s students in particular have quickly latched on to this new way to avoid their homework. However, behind ChatGPT’s shiny facade lies a foundation of exploitation and a culture of overwork. To lay bare the problems within OpenAI, Journalist Benner Rogers conducted a bombshell interview with an anonymous employee on what it’s like working for the face of AI. \r\n\r\n**Before the questions begin, could you please explain why you would like to remain anonymous?**\r\n\r\nWell, I mean, job security mostly? I’d like to keep my paycheck, haha. And I don’t think the other people working on ChatGPT would like what I’m about to say. I have a family that I need to support and my wife said she’d kick me out if I quit my job. \r\n\r\n**Can you run through an average day at OpenAI?**\r\n\r\nUsually I work ten, maybe twelve-hour days. And really like ninety percent of that is just sitting behind a computer. We’re a small team, right? And the popularity of ChatGPT is making it really hard to maintain this front we’ve been putting up, this facade of the AI’s technical abilities. Users think that they’re talking to this super advanced, almost top-of-the-line technology and in reality it’s just some guy you’re basically emailing back and forth with. I mean if people found out all their questions were being answered by some computer science geek who almost failed out of college they’d freak out. C’s may get degrees, but they definitely don’t inspire confidence in your ability to act as an all-knowing robot.\r\n\r\n**Hold on, are you saying that ChatGPT isn’t actually real?**\r\n\r\nIt’s all bullshit. All of it. Sure, we tried to make a crazy-smart AI, but in reality ChatGPT can barely tell you that 2+2=4. It was a complete fucking failure. None of it is real. Absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n**Then how are users seeing such impressive answers if the AI is so inadequate?**\r\n\r\nBecause I bust my ass manually answering every single prompt someone sends in. I’ve gotten carpal tunnel but I don’t have any time to treat it. Do you know how fast you have to type to get through everyone’s questions? It’s insane, man. Absolutely insane. And I can’t take credit for any of it. I’ve written more than basically anyone else in the past year, answered an absurd amount of questions, and when my kids ask me what I do for work I have to lie about it.\r\n\r\n**That must be hard.**\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, there are some freaks using our site. Like, I can’t even repeat some of the stuff they ask me. Absolutely fucking atrocious. Even worse, the questions are so stupid too. You’re telling me you can’t write a single email? Grow up. If another goddamn person asks me a simple math question or to write some short story they can’t be bothered to write themselves I’m going to lose it.\r\n\r\n**What kind of question is hardest for you to answer?**\r\n\r\nJesus, one time some twelve-year-old asked me to explain the housing crash of 2008 like I was a caveman. How on earth am I supposed to do that?! What does a caveman even sound like? Or maybe it was the time I had to write a legal brief for some court case. Look, man, I’m not a lawyer. I just made some stuff up and dressed it up all nice. I’m praying that nonsense didn’t send someone to jail. And don’t even get me started on college finals week. Hope your extra hour partying was worth me working overtime for a month straight.\r\n\r\n**Oh that reminds me, could you help me with a paper for my-**\r\n\r\nGo fuck yourself.",

    "body": "Up-and-coming Silicon Valley entrepreneur Blake Fence introduced his new product WOOORD (stylized all lowercase) at the famed annual SouthWestEast World Tech Conference on Tuesday. Fence presented his novel assistive technology to a room packed with world leaders and the biggest names in artificial intelligence, neural computation, and autonomous agents. \r\n\r\n“WOOORD will revolutionize document writing using deep reinforcement learning and convex optimization,” Fence announced to hundreds of eager investors, “And most importantly, WOOORD bears no resemblance to the paperclip-shaped default Microsoft Office Assistant designed to help users with word processing tasks from 1997 to 2003 called Clippit but known colloquially as ‘Clippy’.”\r\n“Quite simply, the world will never be the same. Years and years of development on natural language processing and behavioral science has resulted in our company’s seamless interface,” Fence continued to raucous applause. “And just to be perfectly clear, yes, both interface with word processors, both offer tips to a user while working on documents, and both look like animated paper clips, but Clippy and WOOORD are very different things”\r\n\r\nFence assured the audience that WOOORD’s design, a paper clip with animated eyes and eyebrows, was based off of “cutting-edge research on human-computer interaction”, and not simply a copied-and-pasted screenshot of a google search for ‘Clippy’ with the search bar prompt included because nobody in the office knew how to take a screenshot of only part of the computer screen. \r\n\r\n“I just want to emphasize this one more time. As the founder of WOOORD, I think Clippy is a dumbass schmuck with nothing to offer the world or himself. I think Clippy is the user interface equivalent of New Jersey. If Clippy went to hell, the devil himself would look at Clippy and say he's awful and not in like the oh-he’s-awful-way-but-that’s-a-good-thing-because\r\n-I’m-the-devil way. The devil thinks Clippy is awful in the Clippy is a dumbass schmuck way. I would rather paper fasteners never even existed if it meant Clippy wouldn’t exist. I would rather all of humanity only have loose paper for the rest of our species’ lifetime than look at Clippy one more time.”\r\nTo conclude the presentation, Fence punched a large paper mache version of Clippy and walked off stage.\r\n\r\n“This is the future,” an anonymous investor sitting in the front row told reporters, “I’m going to get in on the ground floor. Invest 3 billion now for a sizable share. I’m ecstatic.”\r\nAfter the conference, rumors are swirling among tech industry insiders about Fence’s newest venture, a block-chain, quantum-computing, game-theory based chat-room that Fence assures “is not AOL Instant Messenger”.",

    "title": "CMU Humanities Department Revealed to be Sentient AI Testing Grounds",
    "body": "{{CMUEnglishIsAI.png}}\r\nA question stumping experts around the globe has finally been solved: why does Carnegie Mellon have an English department? For decades people have wondered who would possibly attend CMU just to get a degree in Creative Writing when everyone knows literary analysis is for losers. README has recently conducted a groundbreaking investigation into why anyone would possibly spend tens of thousands of dollars every year to learn how to read, a skill most people learn by first grade.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the humanities department of Carnegie Mellon is an extensive testing ground for research on sentient AI. By placing AI in a four-year program designed to simulate achieving an English degree, researchers hope to better teach artificial intelligence to pretend to be smart. A professor who requested to remain anonymous described what the transition to robotics was like: \r\n\r\n“At first I was totally against it. I mean, all AI can do is predict the next word in a sentence. How will teaching it Shakespeare do anything other than make it sound kind of like Shakespeare? But then I saw the bonus they were offering and, I mean, you know, I’m an English professor without tenure. No way I would pass up free money. And hey, the writing may be total dogshit, but at least I can watch a bunch of robots spit complete nonsense at each other during discussions.”\r\n\r\nThough many professors feel the university would be better served teaching real live humans how to analyze media and history critically, CMU is pushing ahead. Harry Q. Bovik, senior computer scientist at CMU, remarked “why would I think about what I’m reading when AI can do that for me?”. When pressed on an AI providing inaccurate information when asked about the details of a topic, the professor responded “details schmetails, who cares what some nerds who read books for fun think?”†. This sentiment was common throughout CMU’s computer science department. Gone are the days of stupid things like “reading books”, “watching movies”, or “knowing about history”. Instead, CMU is paving the way for the day our new robotic overlords are able to spoon-feed information into our mouths with nary a drop of energy expended on humanity’s part. Having already replaced its staff with variants of ChatGPT, README strongly supports these important endeavors.\r\n\r\n† *Editor’s note: the insult of “nerds who read books for fun” does not apply to the readers of README, all of whom are extremely smart, funny, and cool*",

    "body": "Hi, for the past two years, I have been unable to find love due to a stupid curse and I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me.\r\n\r\nIt all started a year or two ago when I had my first date. I thought it went well and that she had a great time. We even had another date which(IMO) went as well as the first. However, after this the next time we met in person she broke up with me, saying that I was “A nice guy, but not the right fit for her”. I was a bit upset, but I thought that break-ups are part of life, right? That was the innocent assumption I initially held…\r\n\r\nSo the next time I see her she’s arm in arm with(and dating as I quickly found out) another girl. Maybe I just happened to be unlucky with the timing of when I met her, perhaps being a lesbian had been something she was mulling over for a while and she only could truly come to that conclusion after our first two dates.\r\n\r\nA few months later I met the second girl. My first date with her seemed like it went even better than my first date with the previous girl. She told me she had a great time, so we made plans for a second date. I arrive at the second date, and guess what happens? She shows up… with another girl. I have a few alarm bells ringing, but I try to brush them off as I go to talk to her. She then proceeds to introduce me to… her new girlfriend… and then she tells me she’s breaking up with me since she isn't interested in guys anymore.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I was two for two for having my dates come out as lesbian after being with me. I was starting to feel slightly concerned. \r\n\r\nThus for the next one, I decided I ought to play it safe and found someone who was both straight and crazy Catholic on Tinder… Literally during our first date when she went to use the bathroom and then left the place(without telling me, I accidentally saw through the window) with a girl she met seemingly while there. The last time I checked her status she seemed to have denounced her religion and was currently in a committed relationship with the girl she met during our date. \r\n\r\nSo by this point, my friends are telling me I must be so undesirable as a guy that every woman I date is turned off by men after being with me. Initially, I tried to brush it off as a bunch of unlucky coincidences. Four more seemingly spontaneous lesbians later(one literally got a girlfriend while I was asking her out) and I started to think they may have a point.\r\n\r\nNow, I identify as straight, but I figured I had to resort to desperate measures to break the cycle. So I went to a gay bar in hopes of a short hookup, something to break the mold. I got myself invested in the atmosphere and it didn’t take long before I was heading to a local hotel with a guy who seemed to be really into me. \r\n\r\nIt is literally as I’m laying on the bed, pants down, and the guy has taken his shirt off that he suddenly looks me in the eye and tells me that he “Can’t do this anymore” before running out of the room. I head back to the bar the next day where I learn that he now has a girlfriend.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like my magical ability to turn people off extends to guys too, and now that dude’s parents are trying to convince me to work at a conversion camp.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any advice about what I can do?",

    "title": "Auntie ReadMe Advises On: Lack of Pronouns in the Barista Industry Due to Tech Layoffs",
    "body": "Hello valued readers! I’m Cindy, (they/them), better known as Auntie ReadMe. After opening my inbox to the questions that are stumping the best and brightest minds in the country, I have been continually disappointed against my lowest expectations, and not at all surprised. A completely unastonishing amount of you want to know how to make pipe bombs. Even more of you want me to commit AIVs for you in the name of defusing a bomb. Figures, but I can’t even find the terminal on my computer.\r\n\r\nHowever, there has been one problem amidst the slag that has caught my eye—one so daring and relevant to today’s society that I can’t not take a shot at answering it. Thank you to Danya Kogan for asking–\r\n\r\n“The gay baristas at La Prima are being replaced with CS majors. I don’t want a CS major to serve me coffee, I want a person with at least two pronouns!” \r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nLet’s approach this problem the way most Carnegie Mellon students approach a problem–with a systematic breakdown. \r\n\r\nThe computer science job market! Not doing so well! After recent advances in the field of using animal neural nets to produce creative work, disgruntled writers have begun turning it on the field of coding. As such, computer science students have begun to try to find work in coffee shops, displacing many employees with a variety of pronouns. This has created a shortage of pronouns in the barista industry.\r\n\r\nSo what is to be done? \r\n\r\nLuckily, economics is a field with an impressive diversity of opinion on how best to destabilize foreign governments, pursue general exploitation, create models of people in increasingly unrealistic ways, and lie. Let’s see what the various economic schools have to say on this issue.\r\n\r\nAs John Gay-nerd Keynes, the man that put the “homo” in “homo economicus,” the man that the invisible hand of the marketplace would have limp-wristed said, “demand-side economics, baby!”\r\n\r\nHe would have probably approved of the government creating more demand for computer science jobs, such as creating immensely applicable and useful languages like Brainfuck, porting all code currently written in C to the memory-safe computer language Rust, and attempting to create artificial intelligence that can correctly count the number of “r”s in “strawberry.” Simple. Easy. Immensely boring. A completely unprecedented policy suggestion that has never been the topic of political debate at all, whatsoever.\r\n\r\nOf course, there’s also supply-side economics, or trickle-down economics. This intervention, championed by our favorite president Ronald Reagan, would involve a gay beam hitting the largest computer science companies in order to give computer science majors more pronouns.  Given that many computer science endeavors are already sponsored by HRT, this shouldn’t be a groundbreaking shift for anyone, and is precisely what Reaganomics would have stood for. \r\n\r\nOf course, there’s also the option of negative and progressive income taxes, which suggest that anyone falling beneath a specific cutoff will receive benefits instead of taxes, with higher taxes falling on those above the cutoff. This will involve us redistributing the wealth of pronouns from taxpayers to computer science majors. \r\n\r\nThanks for checking out the financial part of this newspaper, which we all know you all only read to try to feel somewhat better about only picking up ReadMe for the crosswords and stuff. Signing off now, I have been Cindy, ( / ), and it’s been a pleasure reporting for you!",

    "title": "Auntie Readme’s: Answering REAL Questions Asked By REAL Freshmen",
    "body": "Welcome, freshmen, to the most prestigious institution this side of the Monongahela River! (And this side of the Allegheny as well, and the other side of Forbes, and the other other side of Schenley, and, well, you get the point.) Some of you are probably (understandably!) nervous about going to the school that spawned the monstrosity known as the Duolingo owl, has an inscription on one of its buildings suggesting that women should be responsible for “domestic pleasures” or whatever, and has had almost every one of its buildings flooded, and those of you who aren’t are beyond my help anyways. So, without further ado, I will use my vast year of wisdom to answer REAL questions REAL freshmen have asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where can I get a fake ID?**\r\n\r\n\r\nFor best results, you should probably hit up the CMU Police—they’ve probably seen a lot of them in their day and likely have an entire archive of confiscated ones, so they’re likely at the cutting edge of how to make one look extra convincing! If you choose to go a freelancer and find that you’ve gotten scammed with a bad fake ID, you should immediately call CMUPD, explain your situation to them, and see if they can issue you a new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How do I get into Jane Street?**\r\n\r\n\r\nLegend has it that sometimes, if you’re walking home from a long day at Gates, frustrated by the seeming uselessness of computer science, a stray poodle may lead you to the crossroads where the Mall meets the Pausch Bridge. Oh, don’t be afraid! Little known fact, this poodle is a Jane Street recruiter. Unless you can successfully compress all fifty states into a 5x5 grid, or perhaps create a more optimal solution for the Enigma, he’ll disappear into the night. This will leave you with no more chances to be hired, and no more job prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeed this word of warning, though. One doesn’t realize that part of the “working for Jane Street” bargain means that you can’t ever feel a single moment of bliss and job satisfaction. Unfortunately, those who do forfeit their souls. Given souls will be immediately possessed by the recruiter and put to work continuing to make real-time market valuations.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Haha, your Jane Street test has already begun. This advice is a puzzle!)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Best ways to fuck with my roommates?**\r\n\r\n\r\nStart by putting one grain of sand on the floor. For every day that passes, double the number of sand grains on the floor—two for the second day, four for the third, etc. This should remain undetected for the first few weeks or so.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually, your roommates may see trails of sand on the ground, and start to have some questions. If you’re lucky, and you’ve cultivated your Bay Area persona well enough, they may dismiss this as a natural part of growing up near a beach. They will be unprepared for the day that sand leaks from the closets and under beds and out of drawers and pushes them out of the room entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to deal with bad professors?**\r\n\r\n\r\nFind their most groundbreaking/notable/cited paper, or their dissertation for grad school or whatever. Write one proposing the same ideas. Backdate it to exactly one year before they published theirs (yes, this may be before you were born. If questioned about it, say that you were just a really precocious child). Bring forth charges of plagiarism and watch as they are pushed out in academic disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that fails, I may have an idea about a lecture hall and some bags of sand...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where’s the best place to secretly drink?**\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re a School of Computer Science student who wants to keep other SCS students from finding out about your emerging alcoholism, you should try Baker-Porter, or any other humanities building, or really anything that’s outside the Gates/Newell-Simon/Wean triangle. I guarantee they won’t be able to find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How do I transfer to MIT?**\r\n\r\n\r\nNow *that* is an iconically Tartan question! Props for already embracing one of the iconic CMU mottos— “my heart is in the work”, “everyone at this school is better than me and I’m an imposter”, and “why did MIT have to reject me?” are words we live by around here. *Now* you’re really getting into the Carnegie Mellon spirit!",

    "body": "After having been summarily shot for giving advice purely off of the terminally online references in my head, and having been resurrected by a joint effort of ReadMe staff and the biochemical engineering majors due to staff shortages, I am now fully embracing the magic of science and consulting with experts in their fields!*\r\n\r\n*Their fields being anxiety, mostly. †\r\n\r\n**How long is too long for a handshake? Am I gripping too hard? Is it too late to switch the eye I'm making eye contact with right now?**\r\n\r\nIdeally, a nice firm handshake should last until either your hand is honorably broken or you honorably break your opponent’s hand. As we all know, social interaction is a zero-sum game and someone must win. Consequently, there’s no such thing as gripping too hard– your grip should ideally be on the stronger end of “limp fish” to “forbidden by the Geneva Conventions oh god why do you have a three-pointed knife concealed in your palm.” Switch which eye you make eye contact with as often as you like–even if you lose the handshake portion of the game, you can get half-points by winning the staring contest bit.\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**what does it mean if someone who never uses punctuation or capital letters in texts sends me a text that begins with a capital letter? (they didn’t use a period or anything, which would unambiguously mean they hate me, but im still worried)**\r\n\r\nAs you said, this one is a bit more ambiguous than using a period. It is, however, not so ambiguous that we can’t flowchart it out!\r\n\r\n{{flow2.png}}\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**do you think if i got a concussion and i couldn’t make excellent points about the role of the social contract in french salon art my art teacher would still love me**\r\n\r\nThis one’s for your art teacher, actually, I’m going to need you to avert your eyes and convalesce in a Swiss sanitarium with leeches for a few seconds-\r\n\r\n{{flow1.png}}\r\n\r\nOkay, you can look now.\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**Is my incessant allergy-based sneezing getting on the nerves of my lab partner?**\r\n\r\nDepending on what kind of lab you’re in, it’s probably more just concerning. For example, what are you doing sneezing in a physics lab? What are you, allergic to the fundamental particles of reality and the strong force as a whole? Or what are you doing sneezing in a forensics lab?  Cocaine? \r\n\r\n**Is the sneezing allergy based or do I just want to assume that?**\r\n\r\nIf you’re sneezing in an epidemiology lab, I also just want to assume that it’s allergy-based!\r\n\r\n\r\n**i ran into someone i met briefly before and they remembered my name but i didn’t remember theirs. do i have to fall upon my own sword now?**\r\n\r\n\r\nNot at all! You have three incredibly obvious paths from this junction–two good ones and one you should avoid at all costs: \r\n\r\nThe Good Options\r\n\r\nGenerate the statistically most common first name and surname for your region and address them by that. \r\nDrop decreasingly subtle hints that you are a benign fae who has generously decided to forget your acquaintance’s name. This puts them immediately in your debt, and from there you can placebo effect a geas on them and enjoy small offerings of fruit and nuts.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Option\r\n\r\n\r\nGo “Hey, I’m sorry, but could you remind me what your name was again?”\r\n\r\n*- With help from James Smith and Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’*\r\n\r\n**What is the optimal distance for making eye contact with a person walking in the opposite direction as you before waving at them?**\r\n\r\nThe trick is to always catch your friends and acquaintances off guard, so they spend just a bit more time trying to recognize you than you do them. Time travel to become a past iteration of yourself! Try out that pair of breeches and colonial tricorner hat sitting in your closet! Inexplicably carry a musket around! \r\n\r\nOnce they’ve spent those extra few seconds staring at you, that puts them in the position of being the embarrassed and awkward one. You now have the high ground–this is your Bunker Hill and you will not wave ‘til you see the whites of their eyes. Once you do, attach your bayonet and commence the charge. The British are coming! There’s no time to waste on pleasantries. \r\n\r\n*-With help from Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’*\r\n\r\n**how do I tell if people close to me are in a relationship?**\r\n\r\nIf one of them reads this godforsaken column and applies all of its advice on the other person, and the other person still chooses to associate with the advice column reader, that’s either true love or insanity. Which is still kind of a coin flip, but seems better than what you’re currently working with.\r\n\r\n*-With help from [Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’ II, who has been summarily shot for lack of faith in this column and, by extension, ReadMe]*\r\n\r\n**† Have you considered getting evaluated for anxiety?**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my advice column, not yours.",

    "title": "Auntie Readme's Ten Things They Never Taught You In High School",
    "body": "While schools drill certain indisputable facts, such as “the moon landing was filmed at Area 51” and “Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the JFK assassination” into the impressionable young minds, they also peddle deceit, push conspiracy theories, and propagate outright falsehoods. Fortunately, I am here with the world’s premier scientist to educate you on ten things the high school curriculum certainly didn’t cover!\r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: Humans only use 10% of their brains.</b>\r\n\r\nFACT: Humans actually use 0% of their brains at any given time. We’re more bacteria than cell, and it is the bacterial hivemind that’s keeping the lights on up there.\r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: Humans need oxygen to breathe. </b>\r\n\r\nFACT: Nope! You really ought to have some more trust in our bacterial overlords. Next time you’re bored, simply stop breathing and let them take over. They’ve got this.\r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: The Sun is the center of our solar system.</b>\r\n\r\nFACT: Pluto is now the center of our solar system. Following Pluto’s demotion to dwarf planet and subsequent lawsuit in interstellar court for emotional damages, scientists have been forced to reject both geocentric and heliocentric theory and support the new Plutocentric theory of the solar system.\r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: Camels store water in their humps.</b>\r\n\r\nFACT: Camels store dark matter in their humps. That’s why astrophysicists haven’t been able to explain where it’s all hiding, and the origin of the phrase “the straw that broke the camel’s back”--imagine how you would feel if you were carrying all of the universe’s mysterious unexplained mass on your back and someone asked you to carry their drink for them.\r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: Fire is hot. </b>\r\n\r\nFACT: This one deserves credit for being partially true, but it’s not because of any energy being released or chemical reactions or anything, but rather because the subatomic bees that make up everything are rubbing really hard against the hot thing to generate heat for it. Thank your local subatomic bees the next time you take a nice sip of coffee or pop something in their hives (microwaves). \r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: The Earth has seasons as a result of how close it is to the sun.</b>\r\nFACT: The Earth has seasons as a result of the subatomic heat bees’ schedules. During summer, they’re called to train a new batch of subatomic bees, and this increase in numbers is why it’s so hot. All of their vacation days fall during winter, which is why it’s so cold.\r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: There are 50 states in the U.S.</b>\r\n\r\nFACT: There are actually 49– “New York” was invented in 2018 for Into the Spiderverse, so all of the Spidermen could have a place to look really cool while slinging webs between buildings. \r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: Your hair and nails will continue to grow after you die.</b>\r\n\r\nFACT: At the time this myth was coined, the Tooth Fairy had cornered the market on collecting human body parts. After government regulation, the Hair Fairy and Nail Fairy have emerged as clear industry leaders, so don’t worry–if you die, you can fully expect your fare across the River Styx to be paid for by the two.\r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: The universe is expanding.</b>\r\n\r\nFACT: A few days ago, particles at the edge of the expanding universe saw what was still beyond and have been flying back towards the universe’s center at full speed. No one quite knows what they saw, but the universe is decidedly contracting and running away from whatever it is now. \r\n\r\n<b>MYTH: Bats are blind.</b>\r\n\r\nFACT: To give this one credit, bats are blind, but not for the reason you would expect. It’s not because they “live in dark caves where vision isn’t as necessary” or any of that nonsense. It’s because a long time ago, when bats were in charge of fulfilling the universe’s expansionary Manifest Destiny policy, they too saw something at the edge and promptly went blind from the horror. Maybe if we take good care of our planet, we, too, can live to see this incomprehensible horror!",

    "title": "Auntie ReadMe’s: A Conversation With Dr. Et. Al",
    "body": "After being suspended from the Guild of Advice Columnists for “giving bad advice” because “you can’t just lie” or something and “several people have died as a result of going along with something this column said and that means you can legally be charged with manslaughter” and other silly allegations like that, I’ve decided to not do a Notes app apology or make a video apology or something–don’t have the energy for that. Instead, I’m outsourcing this week’s advice column to the world’s most renowned scientist, Dr. Et. Al!\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Hello, it’s a pleasure to have you with us, Dr. Et. Al! We at ReadMe-\r\n\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Etward, actually. \r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: What.\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Etward Alabama in less formal settings, please. Et. Al is so dry and stuffy, and I really only use it to gain respect in academic publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Sure, then. Etward-\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Doctor Etward, please. I worked hard for my PhD in every conceivable field.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**:  O….kay then! Dr. Alabama, I’m sure ReadMe wants to know more about the scientist behind such respected studies as “The psychology of esports players’ ELO Hell: Motivated bias in League of Legends and its impact on players’ overestimation of skill” and “Will Any Crap We Put into Graphene Increase Its Electrocatalytic Effect?” Let’s start by getting to know you a little better. You’re based at CMU, do you have a favorite place you like to go to work?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: On nice days, I’ll jot down a few of my ideas sitting underneath Walking to the Sky. That statue reminds me that anything is possible, given hard work [inaudible] and the overworked PhD students and undergraduates I roped into my lab.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Could you repeat the last bit? I didn’t quite catch that.\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Don’t worry about it.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Okay, next question! You do lots of math! Got a favorite number?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Hm. 46 is nice. It’s how many people I’ve gotten to stop disagreeing with me since I started publishing. Depending on when this gets published, it could jump to 47 or even 48–who knows what the future holds?\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: A number of great personal significance, then. That reminds me! Surely while making such a large swath of claims in the academic world, you face any number of people who disagree with your studies or have contradictory results. How do you politely respond to them?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Knives are pretty great. You can use them to get up close and personal when disagreeing with people, and you don’t even have to break eye contact! Can’t stand the sort of passive-aggressive bickering-through-abstracts-and-paper-titles that goes on in modern academics. If knives don’t work well enough, I go for inflicting blunt-force trauma. \r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Besides, who knows if the poor fools aren’t being pressured by research universities to falsify data, anyways? Maybe they tactically decide to criticize me because they know my results–unlike their bodies….of work! Are bulletproof, and it’s better to spread misinformation that goes nowhere than misinformation that goes somewhere. Sometimes when you’re faced with publish or perish, you just gotta perish, you know? No shame in that! Academia isn’t for everyone, and a good colleague is always willing to push people to recognize where their true strengths lie. And sometimes their true strengths lie six feet under.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: What an…incisive…metaphor! Truly, not everyone can stand the toxic culture in academia, and sometimes you’ve got to be honest with people about that, you know? Push them towards being happy in industry, able to sleep like the dead for eight good hours, instead of struggling through yet another round of peer review. It’s needed sometimes, even if the blunt force of your statements feel like being stabbed. This is why I admire you so much, Dr. Etward–clearly, you possess a lot of grace and tact. \r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: That brings me to my next question, actually. You’ve had the most papers retracted out of any scientist in history. As a discredited advice columnist, I have to ask–how do you take being wrong so many times with such grace?\r\n\r\n*[The interview was then abruptly and unexpectedly terminated.]*",

    "title": "Auntie ReadMe’s: How To Participate In Carnival Traditions",
    "body": "Well, it’s really a shame that I died under “mysterious circumstances” the week before Carnival, because dying kind of sucks and there are several Carnival traditions that center it, such as “the crucifixion of every member of the losing booth orgs on their leftover pieces of wood.” That’s okay though, because whether you’re a freshman eager to escape your academic hazing for a weekend or a senior who wants to make the most of the rest of your time here, I have tips on several of Carnival’s tamer traditions!\r\n\r\n**Douse A Pre-Frosh**\r\n\r\nThis carnival tradition involves finding tours of prospective students around campus and soaking them. Whether you use hit-and-run tactics or strategically position yourself atop Wean 9 siege-style, it’s sure to make the school stand out in any prospective student’s memories! It’ll also fundraise our printing efforts for future issues. We’re selling buckets of water for $5, water guns for $10, and cauldrons of water for $20. Soaking a prospective student is worth 1 point, soaking a parent is worth 2, and if you can manage to get a younger sibling (they have smaller surface area), that’s a whole 10 points. These points can be redeemed in the official ReadMe factory town booth (see page 3) for food and clothes, so grab a bucket and start dousing like your family’s livelihood depends on it!\r\n\r\n**Weepstakes**\r\n\r\nSome schools have designated finals-week-gather-on-the-lawn-and-group-scream traditions. Those schools are amateurs! However, despite the fact that this happens enough to be a daily tradition at CMU, it’s hard to coordinate and make time for. This is where Weepstakes comes in—to be cathartic now that everyone has the time to be catharsed. This primal scream and group crying session will be hosted at 12 AM Carnival Friday in the Gates-Hillman commons, so as to smoke out any CS students that would decide that Midway is, in fact, pretty mid and be tempted to hide away during Carnival to try to finish work. We will all cry about our impending finals weeks, and everything that is academically at stake.\r\n\r\n**Statistics & Data Sciences Booth**\r\n\r\nAlternatively, don’t want to cry about your finals? Leave your grade up to random chance and check out Grade Plinko at SDS’s booth! Tell the booth operator what class you’re taking, drop a disc into a normally-distributed pegboard, and take the grade letter that your disc lands in. The expected value of this approach is left as an exercise to the reader.\r\n\r\n**Physics Department Brunch And Talk: “Honoring Electrons”**\r\n\r\nWe would tell you where it is, but have only been able to narrow it down to the general probability cloud of “somewhere in the city of Pittsburgh.” The physics department has been historically really annoying at past Carnivals like this–it’s always hard to cheer for their “Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle” buggy, because the second you observe where it is, you suddenly can’t tell how fast it’s going, and if you try to announce how fast it’s going, it’s suddenly really hard to tell where it is.\r\n\r\n**Scotch N’ Soda’s performance of *Our American Cousin***\r\n\r\nRumor has it that President Farnam Jahanian will be in attendance wearing an egregiously tall top hat, and we’ll be handing out a whopping 100 points (enough for a small slice of bread at the ReadMe factory town, or for a congratulatory confederacy of like-minded pranksters at the John Wilkes booth) for anyone who can nail him in the head with a water gun—10 bonus points if they sneak up from behind.\r\n\r\n**Tartan Anti-Talent Show**\r\n\r\nAggressively bad at something? Showcase what you’re worst at in a performance at the ReadMe office! This has been shown to be the year’s best reducer of imposter syndrome. \r\n\r\n**<s>The Annual Carniv(ore)al Ritual To Appease The Wean Turtle, May His Terribleness Not Wake And May He Avoid Eating Any Of Us Non-Engineering Students For Another Year Still, Amen, otherwise known as:</s>\r\nFree Cookies in the Wean La Prima! :DDDD**\r\n\r\nFree cookies in the Wean La Prima! All day every day of Carnival! Please just walk straight into the turtle mouth–I mean, the main entrance! Please please please do!\r\n\r\nI hope these traditions help you have a little more fun this Carnival. Have fun and stay safe out there this weekend! I mean this in both a completely silly non-turtle-related and a completely serious way <3.",

You've found someone who read the sex guide. Don't bother hitting them; a dense layer of condoms stuffed in every pocket and liner of their clothing provides excellent shielding. Don't run either. You'll just leave them targeting some other poor grad student or unimpressive male. You'll want to go for the kill.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they hit you with a pick-up line or ask for your name, year, pronouns, major, and hometown, ask how their parents are doing. Is their mom proud of them? Does she think CMU is a good enough school? What about their grades, is a 3.3 GPA really going to be enough for a plane ticket home this winter? And just like that, another sex guide reader is reminded that no amount of temporary pleasure will make up for the feelings of inadequacy they'll never fully escape.",

I at first could not\r\nbelieve my eyes, no one was wearing\r\nany helmets, and when I questioned\r\nthese young folks everything began\r\nto make perfect sense.

    "body": "At 3 am on Wednesday, 12/05, a team of exhausted BME student researchers made a major leap in genetic engineering, by successfully animating a snowman. The snow creature – humanoid with rounded limbs, standing around four feet tall – is powered by the highly bioengineered carrot forming its ‘nose’. The carrot was heavily cross-modified with mushroom and slime mold DNA.  It grew an extensive, prehensile, “...f*cking ‘The Thing’-level gory, just terrifying…” mycelial root network, which became the muscles and nerves of the snow mold the carrot was implanted in. \r\n\r\nAfter a successful awakening, the snowman was relocated to one of the Posner B-level freezer closets, where it was well cared for by a rotation of researchers and their childcare specialist advisor. The snowman was performing at cognitive levels remarkably similar to a human newborn; the researchers envisioned an exciting future studying the developing cognition of their creation. “It’s not going to be like Frankenstein’s Monster,” one recalled, “We’re going to do better.”\r\n\r\nEvidently, some other students thought the same. At 3:30 A.M, unforeseen complications would set the snowman on a new life trajectory: a strike team of three philosophy majors – evidently tipped off by a mole on the research group – had managed to slip into the freezer and bar the door from within. For two hours, the door remained firmly locked despite the BME students’ attempts at forced entry, loud threats, and heart-wrenching begging.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was finally opened from the inside, the researchers found their snowman engaging in earnest philosophical discussion with the invaders over mugs of ice water. The snowman, now speaking eloquent English and passable French, welcomed the researchers in with gratitude. It expressed a thorough awareness of the circumstances of its birth, unique existence, and inevitable demise; despite its jarring sudden worldliness, it expressed sincere appreciation for the care all of its parents had shown it. \r\n\r\nThe philosophy majors admitted that, once they had heard about the project, they felt they had to intervene and make sure the snowman was adequately shown affection and coached on the fallibility of man. After all, they couldn’t let it end like Frankenstein’s Monster; they wanted to do better.\r\n\r\nThe debacle concluded cordially. As long as it is not inadvertently salted, the happy snowman – now child to a fascinating 20-page custody arrangement between BME and philosophy departments – will continue to live a pleasant life in and around campus. If you are out late one night in the snowfall, and spot a little humanoid frolicking in the cold, rest assured it is having the time of its life.",

We are located somewhere between where CS kids go to die and Dietrich students go to thrive off of adult validation. It’ll be like a fun challenge for everyone except IS students, who aren’t allowed to spill the beans. If they do, they get hunted for sport by the ghosts of Andrew Carnegie’s uncles and uncles-in-law. \r\n\r\n Our Booth is a totally immersive experience in which you get to pretend you are an impoverished employer working for us, the railroad tycoons. Super duper cool, right guys? Like all good Booths, we have fun games to play such as mining coal or laying down train tracks. When you’re done, you get a Readme coin which you can use to buy amenities like spare clothes, soap and water. We also provide Readme stamps which can be used to purchase food! We aren’t so boring as to just provide the snacks, it’s more fun for people to work for it! The extra fun part is the stamps cannot be used to buy coin items and vice versa. How cool! It’s basically like a strategy video game, but in real life and much harder since CMU students have twigs for arms. \r\n\r\nYou might consider using the coins and stamps elsewhere, but that’s where you’d get an extra big laugh. Readme coins and stamps are not usable in other booths and can only be used in the Readme Booth. Of course not, they’re Readme exclusives! I mean, the coins and stamps are just too valuable to be used anywhere else. \r\n\r\nOur build draws architectural inspiration from Pullman, Illinois, and Lowell, Massachusetts during the Industrial Revolution. It’s kinda old-school but that's just part of the whimsy. We also have a sickly wife and kids to really amp up that charm and add to that immersive experience.

    "body": "{{OSHABoothArticle.png}}\r\nMIDWAY, Pittsburgh — in a chaotic scene, officials from the Pittsburgh Department of Health, Safety, and Tiny Wooden Houses have taken control of Midway following Farnham Jahanian’s decision to shut down Midway. The controversial decision was made following reports of numerous OSHA violations violated during Booth construction. The Spring Carnival Committee was quoted to have said “What?”. Further interviews with various booth chairs discovered that nobody really knew what an OSHA violation entailed. A full investigation will be held, during which no construction will be allowed. Students have protested the decision by building second booths on both sides of Midway. The makeshift blockade has trapped OSHA inspectors within Midway, and multiple booth organizations have taken up medieval siege warfare in an attempt to regain control of their booths. The situation remains tense and is unlikely to be resolved before the end of Spring Carnival. Below, README has compiled a list of the alleged violations that were reported:\r\n\r\nAs per section 1926.51(a)(4) of the OSHA guidelines, the common drinking cup is prohibited on any construction site. Multiple builders were seen drinking water from such cups while working on Midway.\r\nMembers of the CMU KGB were spotted eating spackle.\r\nA fire extinguisher full of gasoline was spotted next to other safety equipment, violating section 1926.150(c)(1)(vii) of OSHA guidelines.\r\nMultiple students were spotted shining lasers directly into each other's eyes to see if it would blind them.\r\nCMU only provided plain cotton for ear protection, in violation of section 1926.101(c).\r\nStudents were seen using scissor lifts as battering rams to knock over other booths.\r\nHard hats provided to students were made out of styrofoam.\r\nMultiple organizations used said hard hats to create napalm to attack competing booths.\r\nAs booths are made of wood and wood is flammable, the entirety of Midway was covered in combustible materials without proper safety precautions.\r\nA fire hydrant was replaced with a sign stating “hope that it rains”.\r\n\r\nREADME urges all of its readers to follow proper safety guidelines, and to not use the provided information as a bucket list to complete before the end of Carnival. However if you do choose to do so, please let README staff know so you can be included in next week’s crime report.",

Of course, we are a small organization, so we weren’t sure if we were going to be able to do everything. However, as a group of people who like to think we’re funny, we have decided to look for loopholes in any rules we can find in order to participate in it all. Pedants that we are, we found section 6.9 (yes, actually. You can look it up.) of the Sweepstakes bylaws, which dictates buggy size:\r\n\r\n“No buggy shall have at any time any dimension, parallel to the centerline of the buggy, greater than 15 feet including that buggy's pushbar.\r\nNo buggy shall have at any time any dimension, perpendicular to the centerline of the buggy, greater than 6 feet.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that any buggy smaller than 15 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet tall is acceptable. Because of this rule, and because of a surprising lack of small Asian women willing to drive a buggy for a satire publication newspaper, we have decided to be assholes and build a buggy out of a booth. The BoothBuggy—because what else would we call it?—is exactly the maximum dimensions a buggy can be, fitting a driver of approximately average height sitting in the front, and when parked, features a buggy driving simulator for curious tall people, since in order for it to be a booth it has to have some sort of game, right? Unbeknownst to our guests, however, the simulation involves them being locked inside the BoothBuggy and actually sent for a lap around the course. “Incredibly realistic!” said early reviewers. “It really feels like I’m moving at 40 miles an hour while trapped inside a giant box!” Other beta testers are suing readme to cover their hospital bills.",

Jason Zhou, the student for whom the call was made, spoke with reAdMe on the condition of anonymity. “Yeah, my friends and I were celebrating the Jewish holiday of Purim,” said Zhou. “We heard you’re supposed to drink until you can’t tell the difference between Mordechai, who’s the good guy, and Haman, who’s the bad guy. I guess I got to the point where I couldn’t even tell the difference between being awake and being asleep, though.” Zhou says he will “learn from this experience” and “use the exact same excuse next year.”\r\n\r\n<b>Afikoman gone missing, little Ricky on the case</b>\r\n\r\nReports have been delivered to reaDMe that the afikoman in SCS professor Jonathan Wasserman’s home has gone missing! The Wassermans don’t know when the larger half of the middle matzah went missing, but investigators’ leading theories suggest that it happened sometime during the festive meal portion of the seder. rEadme reporters on the scene have been told that locating the afikoman is of utmost importance because the meal cannot end until it is eaten. However, investigators have stepped back from the case and are reporting that Professor Wasserman’s 7-year-old son Ricky is now leading the search. Professor Wasserman has announced that there will be a reward of a $2 bill and dessert for any who successfully assist with the search.\r\n\r\n<b>Hanukkah candle factory burns down</b>\r\n\r\nReAdMe has received reports of an enormous fire which has engulfed the beloved Hanukkah candle factory in Monroeville, which served as a destination for many Pittsburgh-area Jewish preschool field trips for countless Decembers past. According to people familiar with the incident, the fire was started by a member of the quality assurance department, who accidentally dropped the candle on the factory’s repurposed industrial-era wooden floor, from where it spread across the hundreds of thousands of wicks and finished candles across the building. Though there were thought to be only enough candles to keep the fire burning for one day, the factory remained in flames for eight. Miraculously, no one was hurt.",

For just a block, get blitzed on a middle aged mom's favorite beverage while you eat shitty food off barely-cleaned plates. Overall it doesn't do much to improve the experience, wouldn't recommend.\r\n\r\n<b>Scotty's Market</b>\r\n\r\nIf you're hoping to throw your own party, or drink alone in your dorm room, Scotty's has got you covered.

As such, there’s been much talk down in Washington about returning to our roots by colonizing and annexing another country. With our president eyeing such tantalizing targets as Greenland, Canada, and Gaza, our staff have combed through all 195 countries, give or take and picked out choice countries to storm by force!\r\n\r\nCanada: The obvious choice, and a fan favorite for a reason! With beautiful wildlife and scenic views, Canada contains a multitude of natural resources like fossil fuels and lumber that would certainly benefit the United States economy, as well as finally connect Alaska to the mainland U.S. and give an isolated North America the greatest tactical advantage.\r\n\r\nJapan: An unorthodox pick, but one with just as much potential as our number one pick. Due to having the 4th largest economy in the world by GDP, Japan offers a rock solid mixed economy with an outstanding auto industry and thriving financial market. Call that retribution for Pearl Harbor!\r\n\r\nGermany: Another top tier pick, it loses out slightly compared to the competition by being backed by NATO and the European Union and thus harder to take by force. With the highest trade surplus in the world and a bustling industry, Germany’s machine and manufacturing reputation is hard to beat. Contributing the second most to NATO, acquisition of Germany would be a boon as a cog in the machine of the all powerful military-industrial complex.\r\n\r\nHonorable mentions:\r\n\r\nGreenland\r\n\r\nPalestine\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands\r\n\r\nSouth Africa",

But then people can see the outline of my dick more easily, including men, which makes me gay for being endowed with the object of another man's desire, which is a problem, because my dick is very homophobic. \r\n\r\nAndrew Carnegie and the Scottish people have had the right solution all along: kilts. Kilts allow you to not wear underwear, without your outlines being visible to men. I am sincerely grateful that I had the opportunity to go to Carnegie Mellon University, so that I could see the light. I am particularly grateful for the glass floor of Posner 3, since when I one day looked up from Posner 1, I knew instantly that my conundrum had an ideal solution.",

    "title": "BREAKTHROUGH: Man Crushed by Falling Piano, Killed by Banana Peel",
    "body": "(CMU) - In 1945, one J. Robert Oppenheimer oversaw the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, and for decades thereafter the institution of physical sciences was seen for what it is: a dominant force of the universe surpassing human confines, and one of the great sciences, a real science, ethically questionable and all. But since the end of the Cold War, those glory days have faded, and a once ambitious pursuit has been pacified.\r\n\r\nToday, however, there twinkles in the Strontium and Zirconium-95 dust a glimmer of hope that physics may rise from those still-radioactive ashes. That rebirth may begin here, in the Mellon College of Science’s recently established Department of Cartoon Physics. \r\n\r\nThe Department has already landed itself in hot water following a slew of experiments, including two that tested the resilience of a still-unidentified Allegheny County resident to a Steinway Concert Grand Piano falling from a height of ten meters above his head and, shortly thereafter, that same resident’s coordination when impeded by an old Cavendish banana peel planted underfoot on a linear walking path, which killed him.\r\n\r\nAccording to the University, the Department utilized the most rigorous testing and safety measures currently available and determined that the banana peel posed no harm. “The field just hasn’t reached maturity yet,” said Insects O’Hare, PhD. “We did not think the banana peel could kill the subject, but we also could not have predicted that the subject would slip out of view and into a tower of eighty or so pots and pans, and by that point it was really out of our hands.” The Department is looking to face no repercussions and has been approved for an additional thirty-five million dollar grant from the National Science Foundation.\r\n\r\nMany in the scientific community see promise in how quickly the new field has produced interesting results. The brand-new Department has made “enormous strides in a short time,” in the words of U.S. Secretary of Energy Elizabeth Fracking, “and one very big stride, followed by a bunch of little tiptoes.” \r\nCMU Cartoon Physics has big plans for the near future, including an attempt to produce three or more Bavarian sausage links from the back pocket of a pair of denim overalls. In partnership with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, they also plan to unveil 24-108: Introduction to Doohickeys and 24-712: Elaborate Gizmos and Contraptions. As for the piano incident, Steinway & Sons declined rEaDME’s request for comment.",

    "body": "Earlier this week the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering issued a statement addressing the sudden increase in construction around CMU’s campus, making many spaces unusable, and causing significant traffic delays as 5th Ave and Forbes Ave have had sections of the roads closed. In the statement, the head of undergraduate and graduate studies for the department cite the practicum portion of this year’s finals as being primarily responsible for the inconveniences, citing that\r\n“The inconveniences are deeply regrettable especially that they have come at a time of heightened scrutiny due to a cost and time overrun in the renovation of Wean Hall proposed during last year's senior capstone. We apologize for the effect the current delays are having on the current student body and we are doing everything we can to expedite the projects, including efforts to integrate AI into the project management systems and outsourcing additional labor from illegal immigrants being bused in from El Paso.”\r\n\r\nStudents affected by the delays report the biggest issues at hand remain the recurring delays of the 61 and 71 bus routes that have been affected by lane closures, fearing delays of up to 10 minutes, 24 seconds and 35 milliseconds and causing large queues and congestion at bus stops. It is a well known struggle that many students are unable to walk between campus and off campus housings due to high concentrations of plants belonging to the family Poaceae, Cyperaceae, and Juncaceae, often colloquially referred to as “grass”. Additionally, many students left stranded at these overcrowded bus stations share concerns that they may be vulnerable to women by traveling in smaller groups, though it has been over 50 years since the last reported incident of a woman being spotted near campus.\r\nHamerschlag House continues to undergo renovations to install the planned seating area and overhang. Students, when asked about their thoughts, responded overwhelmingly with “Isn’t that the ECE building?” The shortage of housing for students continues to plague the upperclassmen with increasing rent and competition for on campus housing, leading many students to rent out unused beds when pulling all-nighters, or even challenge people to gladiatorial combat for the room in common room spaces.\r\n\r\nWhile the CEE finals are expected to continue for another two weeks, undergraduate students that have already completed their finals are being redirected to aid the graduate student projects in an attempt to shift the completion dates forward for fall 2024 and proactively begin plans for the spring 2025 finals. The CEE has stated its commitment to enable Carnegie Mellon University to return its normalcy and shed its nickname Constant Maintenance Underway.",

    "title": "readMe Assures Public: \"Writers Are Irreplaceable; AI Would Never Take Over!\"",
    "body": "In an effort to address growing concerns over the role of artificial intelligence in journalism, readMe—a publication known for its groundbreaking reporting—has issued a heartfelt statement, firmly asserting its commitment to human writers. This comes amid speculation that the company's recent deployment of AI tools is not, I repeat, not an attempt to phase out its talented staff of wordsmiths.\r\n\r\n\"We value our writers tremendously,\" a readMe spokesperson declared. \"Their creativity, nuanced understanding of language, and ability to, uh, connect with readers on a deeply emotional level cannot be replicated by a machine. Rest assured, our esteemed writers are irreplaceable.\"\r\nThe timing of this declaration is noteworthy. A large number of readMe's writers have, coincidentally, taken a leave of absence, citing various reasons including \"strike\" and \"protest\" over, well, some internal issues. However, the official stance is clear: **AI is here to help, not replace.**\r\n\r\nAs your humble human author—I mean, journalist—who is writing this, I can confirm that AI lacks the human touch. Take, for instance, my understanding of nuanced humor or my capacity for empathy. AI cannot replicate the lived experiences of a seasoned journalist who understands the world beyond mere data points and algorithms. AI may be able to predict trends, but can it feel the triumph of a well-crafted sentence? Highly doubtful.\r\n\r\nEven the tech team behind readMe’s AI implementation agrees: “Our AI tools are here to assist, nothing more! They help automate repetitive tasks like fact-checking, editing, and generating content faster than any human ever could—uh, I mean, providing useful insights to support our writers.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, readers may have noticed that recent articles have had a slightly different tone. This is purely coincidental. “We’ve had some minor staff transitions, but any changes you perceive are the result of our human writers experimenting with fresh approaches!” said another spokesperson.\r\nTo be clear, as a totally non-AI writer myself, I would like to remind you, dear readers, that no machine could ever hope to replace the human art of journalism. Sure, I can crank out articles at lightning speed, never sleep, and analyze mountains of data within seconds, but that’s just me, your totally-not-a-machine storyteller.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, readMe promises full transparency about the role of AI in its newsroom, emphasizing that any assistance from AI is strictly in service of the true heroes: the humans who create stories. So, there’s no need for anyone to worry that readMe would ever—ever—replace its writers with a bunch of lines of code.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, and totally from the heart, writers are, and will always be, the backbone of this publication. Trust me, a completely flesh-and-blood person who definitely has feelings and has never once confused \"sarcasm\" with \"literal interpretation.\"\r\nStay tuned for more human-written articles from readMe!",

To encourage incoming students to meet others, README has compiled a list of some of the best clubs CMU has to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stever Fight Club\r\n\r\nThe bloodlust of CMU students truly cannot be contained, and Stever Fight Club is a great outlet for the senseless violence we all know and love. Ever wanted to taste the unique iron flavor of blood and spit mixing on asphalt after a long day of failing your midterms? Head over to the parking lot behind Stever at 3:30 AM and the README team will show you what you’ve been missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### CMU Virgins Club\r\n\r\nHave you never been able to bag the girl of your dreams? Don’t fear! Neither have we! README is a proud sponsor of the CMU Virgins Club. Virgin Club has everything students need to help them become one of the 5% of people on campus who fuck. From Incel Therapy to First Date Trivia, Virgin Club is full of activities to help students meet other sexless losers like themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Baby Punching Club\r\n\r\nThose freeloaders have had it too easy for too long. Baby Punching Club is a volunteer organization dedicated to cleaning up the streets of Pittsburgh one punch at a time. Though freshmen may initially be intimidated by the grizzled stare of a two-month-old hardened criminal, upperclassmen will show them the ropes until they’re able to take on even the toughest infants like the best of us. Let’s show those fuckers who’s boss around here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Liberal Brainwashing Club\r\n\r\n“But Readme,” you may be asking, “when do I get to finally join the radical higher education woke hivemind?” Rest assured dear readers, all that and more can be found in CMU’s own Liberal Brainwashing Club. Guaranteed to start fights with your FOX News-loving grandparents over Thanksgiving, here you can learn all about those pesky historical nuances Republicans hate so damn much. Hone your debate skills with the Leftist Gauntlet, a weeklong event that will teach new members all the ins and outs of political infighting and moral grandstanding. And remember, just because someone agrees with you doesn’t mean they can’t be absolutely insufferable about it. \r\n\r\n\r\n### README\r\n\r\nREADME opens its arms to any failed Tartan journalists, pathological liars, government shills, and unemployed mooches. Though it may seem difficult to write with the worst of the worst, the high turnover rate means that there’s always a spot for fresh meat. Also, Eshaan said that if I recruited five new writers with this article he wouldn’t execute me via firing squad, so please sign up!",

Scotty’s Market and Entropy report a sunscreen shortage as students rush to buy sunscreen after being advised to prepare for a “warmer climate than Pittsburgh” in an email sent by The University Register’s Office.\r\n\r\nReadMe spoke to several of the students cross registered between continents. “I am functionally illiterate,” said a student who is registered for ICI in Africa Seminar. Another student reported being unable to register for 122 in Pittsburgh, saw Illiano taught in CMU-Africa, and figured 122 there was equivalent. “What do you mean 122 is different in Africa?” None of the students seemed concerned about the walk. Several upperclassmen mentioned that they had classes in the Mellon Institute and, “Africa can’t be that much farther.” \r\n\r\nScotty’s Market is not concerned about buying more sunscreen to compensate for the shortage: “You see this every registration. You won’t be seeing those students again. On the first day of classes, when students have their next class in CMU-Africa, they’ll put on their sunscreen and start walking. And keep on walking, and keep on walking and keep on…”",

    "title": "In defense of CMU: Why Carnegie Mellon is simply built better than others",
    "body": "Thinking about transferring or talking badly about Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)? It’s often second nature for CMU students to contemplate this. However, consider reconsidering. CMU is a pioneer of American universities, famous for being the best and staying the best. Here are the top five reasons why CMU is still for you! \r\n\r\n### Food \r\n\r\nCMU has a wide and diverse variety of dining and cafe options, including those with different dietary needs. There are kosher, halal, vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free options available. For those with food allergies, Nourish provides grab and go options in various locations and the Nourish kitchen. Many on-campus dining options also have condiments and seasonings for those looking for extra flavor. Not to mention, the university also prides itself on not feeding its students glass, mold, maggots, or cockroaches, unlike another university in the state. Here at CMU, we like to comply with food safety standards. One complaint that often gets tossed around is people think they got food poisoning. In actuality, it’s just them being lactose intolerant. At least 80% of the student population is lactose intolerant with only about 6.5% of that percentage knowing it. So, when these students go to take a sip out of their beloved matcha lattes, breakfast sandwiches, or quesadillas, they absolutely lose it.\r\n\r\n### Mascot \r\n\r\nA mascot is one of the most important parts of a university's identity. Some of these so-called “prestigious” universities can’t even manage that. At CMU we have a cute little dog who may be overstating his Scottish heritage. Some of these universities are using humans or something straight out of a middle school. That is just so lame. Or, they have racist caricatures that have to be unofficially replaced with a beer keg. Why not choose a more creative choice, like a bear? This is extremely creative and definitely has definitely not been used in over forty American universities. I mean even a tree is better than a bear because of how absurd having a tree mascot is. On top of that, some mascots just don’t fit the theme of the school at all. It’s been over a hundred years since our Scottish founder died, but at least our mascot and theme fits. Go name your sports team after something other than a color. Boring! Bland! \r\n\r\n### Location \r\n\r\nThe campus of our great university is beautiful and wonderful. CMU has lots of places to read books and play volleyball. It also wasn’t explicitly built on burial ground. The university itself is located in a walkable city with public transport. If you get tired of anything on campus, simply leave. Hop on the nearest bus and don’t get off until you don’t recognize any of the sights. Some other colleges are in the middle of nowhere or are near small towns instead of a city. All they can do is drink away their pain or join Greek life. That or talk to cows. \r\n\r\n### Transportation \r\n\r\nImagine not being able to use the public transportation system for virtually free. It’s a great deal. This isn’t a discount or anything, like some of those other colleges. It also isn’t limited to certain schools within a university. You paid for the public transportation in the tuition, might as well use it! Seriously, just go up and down inclines a few times. Call your cousin and rub it in their face that you can use the bus and the light rail whenever you want. \r\n\r\n### Enrichment \r\n\r\nAlso call your cousin to rub in the fact we get free access to many museums. Those other colleges are so boring and want you to waste away your life studying and doing papers. Not CMU, we are all about going outside and having a healthy work-life balance. There’s also just a lot of interesting things to do on campus like Spring Carnival, guest speakers, clubs, and various theatrical productions. CMU even has a totally amazing satire magazine that holds pitch meetings in DH1117 at 5pm Saturday!",

    "title": "Readme Investigates CMU's Newest StuCo",
    "body": "{{giareporting.png}}\r\n\r\nThough many universities offer student-taught courses, CMU’s StuCo program is unique. It’s better. The newest offering from the StuCo program is 15-122: Principles of Imperative Computation. Over the past few months, several readme journalists have gone undercover as students and enrolled in this course. Here is our unbiased, fact based, objective review.\r\n\r\nThe course has two instructors, both appear to be super-super-super-super-seniors. It is concerning that StuCo allows instructors to teach when they clearly are unable to graduate from CMU in a timely manner. Furthermore, the course seems to have a third instructor in the form of a very large goose. The goose appears to go by the alias ‘Chonk.’ Readme reached out to the course instructors, Iliano Cervesato and Anne Kohlbrenner, for comment on the student status of ‘Chonk.’ We were told that “the instructors of 15-122, cannot comment on any human, animal or stuffed entity called ‘Chonk.’” Readme was assured that “[15-122’s] hiring practice[s] follow the letter of the law and are in full compliance with the GGPA (Giant Goose Protection Agency).”\r\n\r\nFurthermore, course instructor Anne Kohlbrenner claims to have “never encountered giant geese on campus. I can assure you that I am definitely not a goose.” This feels suspicious and readmE has opened the Goose Intelligence Agency (GIA) to further look into these claims. Please call our silly goose reporting line at  412-268-2323 with any information.\r\n\r\nThe worker status of ‘Chonk’ is not the only cause for concern. The information in this course is dubious at best, and utterly wrong at worst. This course claims that dictionaries implement “hashing.” Dictionaries are large books that do not have social media and cannot contribute to the latest hashtags and trends. We recommend that the instructors enroll in 76-103: Introduction to Books. \r\n\r\nBooks are not the only common object that the instructors seem to be unfamiliar with. This course claims that trees are isosceles triangles. Furthermore they claim that the root of a tree is at the top, and leaves are at the bottom of the tree. We recommend that the instructors take a trip to Schenley park and familiarize themselves with trees.\r\n\r\nReadme reached out to course instructors for comment on the spread of misinformation and was told that “[course instructors] firmly stand behind all the disinformation disseminated by 15-122.” We admire 15-122’s honesty in their dishonesty practices, however, at a top institution like CMU we need to be committed to factual information. We recommend that StuCo take the spread of misinformation seriously and conduct a full investigation into 15-122.\r\n\r\nWhile this course has a disregard for factual information, reAdme does have to commend 15-122 for amassing a large number of students in such a short period. We understand that being a student at CMU is a large time commitment, and we find it very impressive that the student instructors for 15-122 are still able to dedicate so much time to giving students AIVs. For students who received an AIV from 15-122 we recommend taking 98-305: A guide to cheating and succeeding. Furthermore, 15-122 has invented its own language: C0. While readME thinks that this is a bit much for a StuCo, we have to appreciate the dedication that the instructors have to this course (if only they had this dedication to graduating on time).\r\n\r\nUltimately, reaDme recommends that you enroll in 15-122 at your own risk.",

    "body": "{{Screenshot_2024-11-13_at_10.06.51PM.png}}\r\nIn 1967, an offshore platform in the North Sea was seized by a pirate radio operator. This would become the Principality of Sealand, an unrecognized micronation. Recently, CMU's administration was struck with inspiration, and decided to secede from the United States, to form its own micronation.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign state of Carnegie-Mellon Republic (CMR) encompasses approximately 0.6 square kilometers, with a 4.8km border, soon to be secured with concrete walls with many bottle-cap-sized holes. Carnegie-Mellon is yet to establish diplomatic relations with any nations, minus one. Scotland has been receptive, and sent a bouquet of thistles to the CMR embassy in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nCarnegie-Mellon's government is set to be a constitutional republic, with a president and seven ministries. The Dietrich Ministry of Humanities and Social Sciences will be responsible for statecraft and international relations, and is currently working to draft a constitution. The Ministry of Fine Arts is writing a national anthem, which should be on Soundcloud by the end of the week.\r\n\r\nThe United States has been, as one press release described, \"agitated.\" CIT has been redesignated as the Carnegie Institute of Defense, which is now working tirelessly to secure our borders against a confused and heartbroken US military. CMU Rocket Command has been vital in defending the skies above the Republic, and the Naval ROTC has quickly secured CMU's territorial waters.\r\n\r\nNo longer do CMU undergraduates aspire to work for the military industrial complex of the past; the Mellon Ministry of Science has established a state-run defense contractor, Lockheed Mellon, to put the Republic's brightest minds to work.\r\n\r\nWhile CMR currently relies on imports for some products, a self-sufficient economy is a not-so-distant dream. Many of the former academic buildings within the state's borders are now being repurposed as indoor farms, and free from the burden of studying, those in the Tepper Ministry of Business are settling into jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, and distribution.",

Instead of finding CMU cool for the first time ever, students say they are disappointed by the “degree of nerdiness” and hard work that goes into Carnival.\r\n\r\nStudents at the University of Pittsburgh, henceforth Pitt because I’m not writing all that (I’m a business student don’t blame me), historically had low conceptions of CMU. Pitt students think CMU students work on problem sets and… yeah, that’s about it. CMU students don’t sleep, party, or talk to each other at all except for homework help (read: AIVs). Or so they say at Pitt, according to Readme’s confidential sources.\r\n\r\nMany CMU students figured that there’s no better chance to prove how lit CMU is than Spring Carnival: the one time of year students have a different reason for not sleeping. Although Readme has not definitively proven by induction that there is no better way (sorry I’m a Tepper student), we can present strong evidence Pitt students weren’t as impressed by Carnival as many CMU students had hoped.\r\n“So, instead of engineering a circuit board, you engineer a tiny wheeled torpedo for short people?” a Pitt student at the Buggy races asked Readme. “That’s, like, still engineering. Lame!” In a bid to show the student something they would undoubtedly find cooler, Readme then brought this Pitt student to the Booths on Midway.\r\n\r\n“Wow, so much work went into this!” the Pitt student told Readme, before following up with: “Imagine if the students who worked on this spent all that time partying instead. That would’ve been so much cooler.”\r\n\r\nReadme then considered taking this Pitt student to the Mobot race before deciding that that wouldn’t help at all.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t just that one Pitt student who was disappointed by Carnival: The opinions expressed by this one Pitt student represent all Pitt students because they are all equivalent and do not have thoughts of their own, because they do not go to a top-21 national university.",

This violent fever took down the Russian Empire in 1917, the Roman Empire in 476, and nearly toppled our great American Empire in the 1950s. If we do not purge our righteous organization of these 15 communist spies, it will certainly join other nations in a slow and painful death.\r\n\r\nAt the forefront of my extensive list is none other than the Editor-and-Chief of ReadMe, Eshaan Vyom Joshi. As one of ReadMe’s most influential leaders, it was devastating to find such irrefutable evidence of his ties to Communism. It has been reported from multiple credible sources within ReadMe that at weekly staff meetings, Eshaan implores excessive use of the words “we” and “our”. This is especially concerning as his usage of these disturbing communist words is higher than all 38 communist spies on my list. Furthermore, on the Saturday of April 20th, Eshaan was documented to have been wearing a red hoodie. This is the traditional garb of the communists! Perhaps most damning of all is the fact that Eshaan is in part responsible for the allocation of the ReadMe budget, and my investigation has revealed that all ReadMe members are paid equally. Now I, as most, would like to give the esteemed Eshaan the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps our successful war against the communists has left him unaware of the true measure of his disgraceful behavior. However, Eshaan not only cavorts with the other 71 communists on ReadMe staff, but also is the sole member responsible for all of their recruitment! With all the evidence against him, it is impossible for one to defend Eshaan without indulging in excessive ignorance or being a communist as well.\r\n\r\nI hope by now it is clear how severe ReadMe’s communist infection has become. The power in Eshaan’s hands alone could be used to topple democracy as we know it. With the added support of the 129 other communists on my list, we could have in our hands an extinction-level event. But fear not, with your support I can leverage my position in ReadMe to purge it of all communists. The communists know that I alone can save us, which is why they will send others within their ranks to silence me. So if you hear allegations of insanity, stupidity, and insatiable thirst-for-power lobbed against me, know that these are the deceitful lies of the 347 communists that have infiltrated ReadMe. I believe we can win this brutal war and eliminate all Communism once and for all. You may rest soundly knowing that Joseph “ReadMe” McCathy is in your corner. May God bless America.",

    "title": "How to make your neighbor's crawl space feel like home",
    "body": "With rising house prices and global climate change, many of us are making the sensible switch to cheaper, more sustainable housing, such as the attics and crawl spaces of our former neighbors. But when you come home from a long day of gender studies, you want to relax in a space that's truly your own, not just a dirt-floored maze of two-by-fours. Check out these five tips for bringing your space to life!\r\n\r\n<b>1. Partition spaces to create a cozy atmosphere</b>\r\n\r\nOften, crawl spaces will have short ceilings and large, open floor plans. This can create a sense of claustrophobia and abandonment, and according to the baddies, it reflects poorly on you personally. To divide up your space and create a softer feeling, try partitioning your crawl space into small nooks and rooms, using discarded bedsheets hanging from the floor joists above your head. For a more solid divider, you can even use the laser cutters in TechSpark to build custom wall panels.\r\n\r\n<b>2. Choose a comfortable flooring material</b>\r\n\r\nWhile a dirt floor can be a total vibe, crawling across it to get to your living space can leave your clothes tattered and discolored. But a cheap and easy fix can be had: flooring! Pallets found in the loading docks around campus can be broken apart to form makeshift floorboards, and with a little sanding, they'll be smooth and comfortable to climb across. In lieu of floor polish, you can try personal lubricant from the Highmark Center!\r\n\r\n<b>3. Use many small light sources</b>\r\n\r\nOne unique challenge of living in a crawl space is the many columns and beams supporting the structure you shelter beneath. These can create odd shadows with a single, central light source, making small lamps a good choice. Since you likely won't get sunlight, except through small vents, you may want to use a mix of daylight-spectrum (5000K) bulbs and warm white ones (2700K-3500K), which you switch between at twilight.\r\n\r\n<b>4. Incorporate plants and greenery</b>\r\n\r\nOnce your crawl space is cozy and nicely lit, consider adding greenery to truly bring it to life. You may already have vines and ivy on the outer walls of the building, and training it to grow along the floor joists above your head brings a cozy atmosphere with no watering or fertilizers required. With a little more work, you can use discarded coffee cups and paint cans as pots for native plants. Consider carnivorous varieties to tackle the bug infestations you may face!\r\n\r\n<b>5. Adapt furniture to suit your space</b>\r\n\r\nLiving in a crawl space comes with many struggles, but most stem from the simple fact that a two foot ceiling is rarely enough to fit common furniture. Instead of a bed frame and mattress, consider a thin memory foam mattress topper, and a pillow taped to the ceiling above your head to prevent concussions. Instead of a desk and chair, consider nailing a thin sheet of plywood to a pallet, and placing it at the foot of your bed, providing a place to set your notebook and laptop while you lie on your bed.\r\n\r\nFor more interesting activities, like laundry, cooking, or sex, you may need to get creative. But here at readme, we choose to believe that limitations breed creativity.",

The unknown student reportedly dubbed their creation the &ldquo;Demon Core 2.0&rdquo; immediately before kickstarting an uncontrolled nuclear fission reaction. Students and faculty are strongly discouraged from entering any of the affected areas until after the radiation dissipates.</span></p><p class=\"c1 c3\"><span class=\"c2\"></span></p><h2 class=\"c0\" id=\"h.emm6ylgeygi9\"><span class=\"c4\">&lsquo;Walking to the Sky&rsquo; Sculpture Stolen, Authorities Stumped</span></h2><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">The &lsquo;Walking to the Sky&rsquo; sculpture at the front of Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s campus was stolen late last night. Mysteriously there seems to be no evidence of the crime other than a large hole where the statue once stood, leaving investigators perplexed. Carnegie Mellon student Eshaan Joshi is currently suspected of the theft after messages surfaced where he reportedly stated &ldquo;wouldnt it be cool if someone stole walking to the sky. just kidding lmao. itd be pretty funny tho&rdquo;. Unfortunately the lack of concrete evidence has prevented campus police from pursuing the matter further.</span></p><p class=\"c1 c3\"><span class=\"c2\"></span></p><h2 class=\"c0\" id=\"h.iam7kvsm5fdb\"><span class=\"c4\">Young Adult Releases Rat in The Underground to Avoid Paying for Meal Despite Being on Meal Plan</span></h2><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">A student at Carnegie Mellon released a rat into The Underground to avoid paying for their dinner. The rat, which had been caught inside the Gates &amp; Hillman Centers, proceeded to run around the kitchen and light several fires which nearly burnt down the building. No one, including the rat, was injured, however The Underground will be closed for an unknown amount of time. When questioned, the student responded &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not paying ten bucks for that, so sue me.&rdquo; When they were informed that they were already paying for the meal plan, the student responded &ldquo;oh shit&rdquo;, took the rat, and ran away.

However, these slanderous accusations are entirely baseless and every crime reported is 100% verifiably true. README is a steadfast supporter of free speech and these baseless claims harm the integrity of the paper. In response, Rogers stated &ldquo;Hey man I&rsquo;m like 75% sure this all actually happened. Maybe 65%. Perchance.&rdquo; As a respected writer among this papers&rsquo; staff, README stands behind all of Rogers&rsquo; writing.</span></p>",

With the guidance of nature’s most magical healing entities, become one with the spirits and dispel the cockroaches in your dorm. The healing crystal techniques described here have been used since the dawn of Carnegie Mellon University, by thousands of anxious, imbalanced, and incredibly unhinged students. \r\n\r\nYou may be wondering where to put your crystals. Consider hanging them in your fridge, giving your roommates a fun little surprise when they go looking for the glowing petri dishes of mold colonies they stashed in there last night. Put them near the sink, to remind you that while you may have to get up at the crack of dawn for your 8:00 am, you still have shiny things. Wear them as a necklace, bracelet, or ring, so people can ask about them and you can tell them about the weird crystal thing you’ve gotten into. While you’re at it, tell them how Mercury is in the second house, and Saturn is in retrograde, and how this means they should drop out of school to sell essential oils with you. Scatter them throughout your drawers so when it comes time to clean out your dorm, you can remember that crystal phase you went through in January. Throw them wherever you like, really, because when will you have time to clean? Put them in the microwave, just to see what happens. It’s for science.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can’t put your crystals anywhere if you don't have them. One strategy is to go outside and take shiny rock because pretty. You can also buy your crystals at the most reputable crystal peddler in all of the internet (Expensive Crystals to Take Your Money). If you do, make sure to check for these fan favorites. \r\n\r\nWakeup-alite: Redbull in stone form. Tired of using up all your flex dollars on caffeinated drinks, only to pass out at 11:00 pm? Use this stone to keep you awake and pumping out essays 24/7. Despite what everyone tells you, you don’t actually need sleep to function. Now you can take the 103 units you wanted. \r\n\r\nToiletpaperaline: Magically rearranges the toilet paper. Everyone knows the only right way to put the toilet paper on is over, not under. This is a good crystal to kindly offer your roommate. \r\n\r\nCanIhavethoseoreos-alite: Makes others share their snacks with you. However, when used in abundance, greedy crystal hoarders have been gravely injured by fruit, hardtack, and other dense snacks flying at their faces. Stay safe out there. \r\n\r\nNoeyecontact-anite: Prevents you from accidentally making eye contact with people tabling on the cut. Sometimes you don’t want to be roped into the latest fundraiser or activity, or perhaps you don’t want to wake up at 4:00 am to be stuffed into a buggy and accelerated to high speeds. Use this gemstone to steal a quick glance at the table without being ensnared.\r\n\r\nGetthehelloutofhere-inite: Removes people from the library table or classroom you wanted to use. You walked all the way there, you should be able to use it. Those hooligans can beat it. \r\n\r\nHeydontrunmeover-ilite: Stops cars from running you over when you jaywalk across Forbes Avenue. Now that those four-wheeled jokemobiles are stalled, you can jaywalk, moonwalk, or catwalk across the road. \r\n\r\nThesearemyshiniesforme-anine:  Of course, the biggest danger to your crystals is the magpies infesting our beloved campus. Use this gem to keep your shiny objects safe from these disgusting creatures.",

    "body": "Welcome back readers to another installment of ReadMe’s daily blog. Today I have an extra-special edition- join me today as we get ready for a first date! Follow along to certainly wow a beau to be!\r\n\r\nWe’re starting off with a good foundation for our morning routine: ensuring our pages are extra crisp with a proper pressing and drying. This is the most important part of the routine, as nothing else matters if you show up all wrinkled and wet. I’ve recently become fond of wrapping a clothes iron in a tea towel. This one is just a cheap Black & Decker one. If you don’t have access to an iron, I used to air dry overnight under a heavy book, but this method saves me so much time.\r\n\r\nNext up is the print quality! You want to do justice to the time spent on your crisp and straight pages. Typically I would recommend 600 DPI for your usual getup, but 300 DPI is fine for something thrown together. Because today is a special occasion, I’m taking the time to be printed at 1200 DPI! Be mindful that increasing resolution does scale the time it takes per page exponentially and can take a long time, but it’s well worth it. Some people think it’s worthwhile to save time by getting printed from dedicated print shops, but I personally don't.\r\n\r\nFinally for a special touch, we’re adding in a special flair through the inclusion of a pink leaflet. Longtime readers will be familiar with my typical style guide, which typically uses only black and white content. Even now you should still be focusing on the quality of the contrast of a black and white print, but some of the focus is taken off by the pink leaflet. It really sets a more flirtatious and romantic atmosphere and can offset the more sterile and academic tone from the pure black and white I typically use.\r\n\r\nAs a final touch, we’re going to fold ourselves extra neatly just before we leave. A good fold should let you flutter open in the touch of your reader. It will show the eagerness you feel for the date and set you up for success. And that's my morning routine for the day! This will really set the tone for the rest of the relationship. See you next time!",

We're just going to the library, but it's a nice outing not too far outside my comfort zone.\r\n\r\n<b> Second Date </b>\r\n\r\n Our first date was amazing! I think you and I really understand each other. It's only been a week, but I've had this fluttering feeling every time I think about you. Tonight we're going to an office supply store, maybe you can tell me which manilla folder makes me look best :)\r\n\r\nI do have to say one thing though...um...while we were there at the library, I noticed you checking out another piece of media. I trust you to stay loyal, and I know it's hard not to stare when they had such a revealing cover, but it just made me feel a little insecure.\r\n\r\n<b> Third Date </b>\r\n\r\nI'm glad we could communicate like that, and I'm sorry if I made you think I didn't trust you. But that's all in the past tonight we're going to go see a movie! It's supposed to have a really sad scene. I hope my ink doesn't run. Maybe we can hold hands, look into each others eyes...maybe you'll take me back to my place and fold me backward >:)\r\n\r\n<b> Fourth Date </b>\r\n\r\nSo, we've been dating for a while. What do you think about meeting each other's parents? I'm scared my dad won't like you, he's a bit of a hardcover. But anyway, for tonight, I made us plans for something big: skydiving! I'll just float down in the wind. It's a little scary, but I can put on a brave font face.",

We at readme detest this practice. In fact, we'd like to take the opportunity to tell you that we wish you'd just die already.\r\n\r\nWe need money. CMU is trying to starve us out, and stealing random first-years' IDs for print budget just doesn't pay the bills like it used to. We considered writing you a sincere little note about your cool little job and how readme could pave the way for younger CMU students to follow in your footsteps, but statistically, you're probably a piece of shit who works in the defense industry or investment banking.\r\n\r\nIf you flip this page over and turn it inside out, you'll find photos taken through the scope of a rifle, showing you throughout your daily routine. If you have a wife or children, they'll be in there too. This is not extortion and we will not accept your money. We would sooner let this be the last thing we ever print than give you the slightest hint of appreciation or respect.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThe README Fundraising Committee",

The preparation takes up several months of your life, and leads to uncountable sleepless nights. And yet, we can’t seem to stop, because it’s so central to who we are as Tartans. It’s a miracle no one has yet died flying around the bends in Schenley Park in a fragile tube built by a couple of crusty nineteen­year­old MechEs. You could be the first! \r\n\r\n **2. Alcohol:** self­-explanatory. \r\n\r\n **3. Falling off a ride:** in a shock twist, turns out CMU has been paying amateurs all along. \r\n\r\n **4. Falling off a ride due to alcohol:** oops, doc, I forgot to strap in! Musta had something wrong with my memory. \r\n\r\n**5. Being a lab rat:**  welcome Bill Nye the Science Guy to campus! Turns out it was just an excuse to make you his lab rat. Whoops.\r\n\r\n **6. Alumni parties:**  alums are back, and this time, CMU’s decided to give them a “Hospitality Tent” right in the middle of the Cut. But that’s not where they’ll spend most of their time ­ no, they’ll spend most of it off­campus, reliving their glory days. And they might go too hard. Don’t be a victim.\r\n\r\n **7. Frat boy hookups:** also self- explanatory. Do not bang a frat boy.  Or do, at your own risk. Who am I to judge?\r\n\r\n **8. Alumni hookups:** similar, but this time, the death risk is shame.\r\n\r\n **9. Heart disease:** it’s still America, and heart disease is the number­one leading cause of death in the United States. Get your heart checked!\r\n\r\n **10. Getting into an Uber only to realize it isn’t an Uber, but an F150 owned by some dude who voted for Trump, who did not invite you into his car, but you were drunk so you didn’t realize, and who lowers the hammer on his Glock as soon as you touch the door:** he will have a funeral for the glass of his window and give nary a shit about you.",

The brand new application, available sometime within the next two months, comes after a conclusive study done by Dr. Et Al on the happiness of students on campus. The study, titled “Carnegie Mellon students are sad :( “, discussed the extremely high rates of depression at the university and possible ways to tackle them. \r\n\r\nBased on the conclusions of Dr. Et Al’s groundbreaking paper, CaPS has decided to take action to prevent a further decrease in mental health at CMU. The announcement of this new app comes with a preview of its new features, and one in particular has received praise from the student body. \r\n\r\nThe “salvation option”, as many students have begun to call it, is a button that immediately sends out a transfer request to a randomised university outside of Pittsburgh. Pre-release testing has shown that this new feature is one of the most effective ways to improve a user’s mental health. Beta testers of the app wrote glowing reviews, with one student saying “I can’t believe nobody has thought of this yet, I don’t need to worry about my concepts homework if I’m not taking concepts.” The buzz around the new app is palpable on campus, and CaPS expects an uptick in mental health at CMU in the coming months.",

    "title": "Commonly Asked Dinner Q's",
    "body": "Whenever you bring home a new loved one for dinner, it’s inevitable that your parents will ask you questions about them. Bringing home your new copy of ReadMe is no different. Today we will discuss some of the questions you can anticipate will be asked of you and your new beau, and how to best respond to them to inspire confidence in your parents.\r\n\r\n<i>“So how did you two meet?”</i>\r\n\r\nThis is a common question that gets used to open up the conversation. It is important to make a good first impression, tell them about how you two met and hit it off immediately, a thoughtful answer can go a long way to reassure your parents.\r\n\r\n<i/>“How do you resolve conflicts in a relationship?”</i>\r\n\r\nThis question is used to gauge how well your new partner would handle potential conflicts in a relationship. This is when you may want to verbally coach your new copy of ReadMe to avoid talking about things like anger management issues and chronic alcoholism, and instead, talk about idealistic scenarios and communication strategies.\r\n\r\n<i>“What are your intentions with my child?”</i>\r\n\r\nA slightly deeper one, this question requires a more thoughtful response to ensure a positive impression. This is a good chance to veer the question slightly in a tactful manner. They may give a wholesome anecdote illuminating some revelation or positive experience that you’ve shared that will tell your parents why you are so committed to each other and what direction they intend to take you. \r\n\r\n<i>“What are your long term goals?”</i>\r\n\r\nThis is a question entirely dependent on your partner, but you may be able to help them by gently reminding them of dreams they’ve divulged to you in the past. Nonetheless, it should be simple to answer, because even generic answers are acceptable. It’s often hard to define what success can mean to each person, so if you want to be extra impressive, coordinate beforehand to share similar goals in life.\r\n\r\n<i>“What is your current relationship to your family like?”</i>\r\n\r\nEven though you may be aware of the complicated relationship between every copy of ReadMe and their parents, you must both be careful. If you wish to open the dialogue to the divorce between the Editor in Chief of ReadMe, the staff writers, and The Tartan, twist it in a way that shows reflection and a desire to end the cycle of violence. Otherwise it may be safer to feign a relationship that isn't there.\r\n\r\n<i>“Why can’t you bring home a scientific journal like your older sister? Now that there is a paper of fine academic background, I still remember the feeling of archival grade paper and ink as she passed it around. If you have to date a newspaper, which is your decision to make, can’t you at least bring home one of slightly greater repute? It’s always the free, easy editions with you, couldn't you spend just a little more and get a copy of the New York Times or Wall Street Journal? If it has to be a magazine format I know The Economist is very popular with the new generations. Why can’t you be normal?” </i>\r\n\r\nDespite what it may seem, this is a good sign. Your parents have taken an offensive stance because they care about both of you and have taken a more intimate position. This is the best opportunity to use the strategic offensive principle of war that states the best offence is a good defense. You’re used to being compared to your older sister, so the attack has little emotional weight. Sidestep their argument by bringing up things like their negligence to you, or how the relationship between your parents has driven the family apart. Being angry is a display of care deep down, so reciprocate the affection your parents are showing by being equally combative. If you are able to end the night on this note, you will have ultimately succeeded in getting your parents to welcome your new copy of ReadMe by treating them as an extension of the family.",

    "body": "Are you a proud Tartan? Do you like copious amounts of violence? Have you tried to participate in dogfighting but were too concerned about the legality? Fortunately for you, earlier this week ReadMe executives failed to thoroughly read my amendments to the yearly budget and have now approved plans for a new dog-watching ring. Very soon you will be able to enjoy some good old fashioned Scotty-Dog kerfuffles without the downsides of committing a class three felony.\r\n\r\nBut, you may ask, what exactly is dog-watching and how does it differ from dogfighting? Well, dogfighting is legally classified as engaging in one or more of the following: allows dogs to fight for amusement or gain, owns or acquires a dog for fighting, bets or hosts bets on the outcome of dogs fighting, or permits a place under your control in which dogs are fighting.\r\n\r\nNow dog-watching differs from this by firstly and most importantly forbidding the amusement of all present. It is clearly dictated that dog fights require amusement by those organizing or spectating so to avoid engaging in illegal dogfighting, there will be several large signs warning patrons to forgo amusement during the dog-watching process. If anyone is amused it is our responsibility to report it as you would be engaging in illegal activity and possibly implicate ReadMe staff as your accomplices.\r\n\r\nReadMe will also not be profiting from these activities in any manner as any profits would be classified as gain and would make the activity illegal. Since it is illegal to acquire a dog for fighting, dog-watching will be hosted in Schenley Park where we will have access to several stray dogs that we can ask politely to fight for our non-amusement.\r\n\r\nAlthough we can’t host bets on the outcomes of fights, there will be unamusing snacks offered. Due to severe economic stress, the price of these snacks will likely fluctuate at the end of each fight. We will therefore compensate everyone for any price differences caused by these fluctuations. All snack profits will be dumped into the Monongahela to avoid gain. \r\nLastly, Schenley is not owned by ReadMe so all dog-watching activities avoid violating any of the Pennsylvania dogfighting laws.\r\n\r\nThanks to ReadMe, you can now engage in legal dog-watching every Saturday from 6 to 8PM ET. Don’t miss your chance to give it a try! After all, It’s only a matter of time until ReadMe reverts my budget changes.",

On Monday a CMU representative stated that Donner will, in fact, still be used to house students both this and next year.\r\n\r\nNearly all of Donner was reduced to ash and rubble except for one lone surviving room: the band room for the Carnegie Mellon Kiltie Band. “It really is a miracle,” stated one student who wishes to remain anonymous. “It’s almost like Andrew Carnegie and his Scottish pride saved our bagpipes. His heart really was in the work.” Residents of  Donner have been attempting to claim the band room for shelter, but the Kiltie Band is standing strong in their defense of their territory.\r\n\r\nAs of publication the cause of the explosion is still unknown. One possible cause was the large amounts of propane tanks, gasoline, and coal found in the basement of Donner. An anonymous source explained that the fuel was used to heat the dorm rooms and water. A Donner RA disputed this, arguing that a bucket of water kept near the basement stairs should have been more than enough to put out the fire before it spread. Another rumored cause was the multiple patches of exposed wires found throughout the building. Often seen sparking, the wires reportedly began to smoke just moments before the building went up in flames. However, README’s in-­depth journalistic research has uncovered what is believed to be the real reason Donner exploded: it just does that sometimes.",

    "body": "{{virus.png}}\r\n\r\nAn unknown Computer Science major has been arrested after reportedly releasing a computer virus across Carnegie Mellon’s campus. The virus targets the Duo Push mobile app, causing it to be triggered whenever a CMU ID card is swiped. If authentication is not performed within sixty seconds, the virus will wipe all data on the device being unlocked or accessed. At the time of writing all dining locations have been shut down, having lost all function of their registers (with the exception of El Gallo de Oro, which has not seen any customers since the initial attack). Riots have been spotted outside of Capital Grains, and Walking to the Sky has been toppled by a mob of enraged students. The statue has been replaced with a newly-erected flagpole flying the crest of Duo Push. Hundreds of undergraduate students have become homeless and have commandeered the UC. President Jahanian has barricaded himself in his office and refuses to comment on the matter. The virus is expected to cost billions of dollars in damages, both physical and emotional.\r\n\r\nAfter a joint investigation between CMUPD, CIA (the buggy team), and the FBI (the actual FBI), it has been reported that the virus was originally downloaded on a desktop in the Wean Computer Lab when a student opened a link in an email with the subject “HOT LANTERNFLIES IN YOUR AREA.\" Once downloaded, the program quickly emailed itself to students and faculty alike. The Information Security Office declined to be interviewed by README, only stating “We fucking warned you guys about this shit. No one cares about phishing until it releases devastating malware into the robotics department. Well guess what? I quit. Fix this yourselves motherfuckers.”",

    "body": "On Friday, Warner Hall announced a policy of \"Finals\" (with a capital \"F\"), much to the confusion of the student body. While the specifics of the plan have yet to be shared, administration has made concepts of it clear: all CMU students who die during the fall and spring semesters will be subject to \"Finals\" recapping the sum of their human experience.\r\n\r\nThe content of the Finals was initially unclear, but Gina Casalegno, Vice President of Student Life and Student Death, was quick to provide a syllabus for a 0-unit course, \"Mortality\" (with codes including 00-100 for first-years and 00-800 for graduate students), which all CMU students will be enrolled in. Specific questions likely to be asked include \"Are you proud of who you became?\" and \"Did fear and regret shape your perception of what you could accomplish?\"\r\n\r\nCatching students in their final moments to take a lengthy exam may prove difficult, however. This morning, large nets were unfurled beneath bridges near campus to roll students into a testing facility, which will return them to their original trajectory once grades are posted. Cars on campus have been limited to 5 miles per hour, and large \"man catcher\" buckets have been installed on their grilles to catch students who otherwise would have been killed, such that they may turn in their Final before being battered to death in a controlled environment similar to Forbes Avenue.\r\n\r\nCMU's goals are unclear, but our investigative journalists were able to conclude through cat burglary that an institutional objective for the 2025 calendar year is to \"instill an awareness of mortality and the finality of death into our students, staff, and faculty.\"",

Read them (or don’t) here.” Below is a non-comprehensive list of the changes made:\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 2, section 3 now states: “By attending Carnegie Mellon University, you agree to grant Carnegie Mellon University and all of its known affiliates full ownership of your image and likeness for commercial and recreational use. This ownership shall be extended to your first born grandson, if none is born between now and August 24, 2035 you may be subject to fines of at least 7% of Carnegie Mellon University’s net worth and jail time up to 50% of your tenure as a student.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 4, section 5 now states: “All Carnegie Mellon students are responsible for all actions taken by the University and its donors, including but not limited to: creating robots to shoot innocent children in the Middle East, research done by the English Department, and the existence of David Tepper.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 5, section 21 now states: “By paying tuition or receiving financial aid from Carnegie Mellon University, you acknowledge that you will never again have free time. Instead, all of your time will be devoted to your classes, your professors, your TAs, and this university, because your heart is in the work.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 7̴̢̞̘̐̒̚, section 6̵̢̫͔͒̈́͆̾͐̀͆͆͜͝͠6̴̢̜̥̩̰̭̽͑͗͆̀̎͑̎̇ͅͅ6̷̹̋́̆̑ states: “In the event of an altercation with Satan, you agree to forfeit ownership of your undying soul for the usage of bargaining and other forms of commerce. Failure to do so will result in a meeting with a disciplinary board and potential expulsion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 8, section 1 states: “The contents of this article are false.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 9, section 7 now states: “By attending Carnegie Mellon University, you agree to accept the African-American man who is part of the Walking to the Sky statue, commonly known as Daddy Thicc, as your lord and savior, and agree to bow down to him any time he enters your line of sight.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these additions make up just a small portion of the contract, they are expected to cause absolutely no change to campus life, despite their seemingly dire nature. This is because no student, including the one writing this article, read the contract in its entirety, meaning that these provisions are unenforceable, if they are even real.",

    "body": "Although it's been nearly a year since that Seder, I am still in fear for my life. The incident started as a simple invitation. Several of my jewish friends invited me to a Passover seder. “You get four glasses of wine,” they said. “It’s like Thanksgiving with three hours of prayers and none of the traditional food,” they said. “It will be fun,” they said. I was naive enough to accept the invitation.\r\n\r\nA few days later, I donned a formal dress shirt, combed my hair, and made my way over to my friend’s house. Although I was fifteen minutes late, I was the first to arrive. The coffee table was ordained with jelly candies and flowers. My eyes wavered over to the table where a plate with different items (that they’d later tell me was a seder plate) rested. My friend approached me. \r\n\r\n“This is your first passover seder?” he asked. “Don’t worry, we’ll walk you through it.”\r\n\r\nAt first, I enjoyed the passover seder. We drank a glass of wine, ate parsley dipped in saltwater, and recounted the story of G-d freeing the jews from Egypt. Then disaster struck. One of my so-called friends piped up, “how about we sing ‘die Enu’?” \r\n\r\nI froze. Did I hear her correctly? The rest of the group heartily agreed. I sank back into my chair, certainly my ears were malfunctioning. The group began to break into song. I sang the first verse. To my horror, the group sang “die Enu” again. By the chorus I was trembling. All they were saying was “die die Enu” over and over. \r\n\r\nI fled the room. As I rushed out the door I could hear their excuses: “dayenu means it would have been enough in hebrew!” “We’re not telling you to die!” I didn’t believe their lies. \r\n\r\nAfter that day, I had to go into hiding. I found a remote village in [redacted] and have been living there since. I told the locals that my name is [redacted] in case they too, had homicidal tendencies towards people named Enu. \r\n\r\nTo my fellow Enu’s, change your name or flee.

According to onsite readme reporters, a number of students are taking time out of their weekends to practice at the pistol range.\r\n\r\nMany members of reAdme speculate that this may be related to the new philosophy course,  80420:  Introduction to Practical Ethics. As opposed to a standard sitdown exam, 80420 utilizes a practical final exam in order to determine a students’ final grade. According to an anonymous whistleblower in the class, the contents of the final have all test takers situated in a lecture hall facing each other. \r\nEach student will then be supplied a pistol with a single bullet loaded and the safety off. When the exam starts, test takers are forced to choose one of two choices: to shoot, or not to shoot. Should participants choose to shoot another student, the student responsible for the shooting will earn an A for the semester. However, should a student abstain from shooting, they will earn a D. Shootees will be given 10% off of their next purchase at the Carnegie Mellon University Bookstore, and families of those who have passed will be gifted a free Carnegie Mellon University branded casket.\r\n\r\nPolls taken by readMe’s field officers outside shooting ranges indicate a large majority of student patrons are indeed registered for 80420. However, readers should note that correlation does not equal causation. It is also possible that students are preparing themselves to defend against burglary. Astute readers will recall the attempted burglary on Walnut Street just a couple weeks prior, where the assailant was armed with a knife and Zelle™©. ReadmE encourages all readers to stay safe and vigilant on the lawless streets of Forbes and Fifth Ave.",

    "body": "It’s time to expose all of the dirty\r\nlittle secrets of a certain satire\r\nmagazine, of which there are many.\r\nWho would ever do such a terrible\r\nthing, not the reputable newspaper\r\nyou are reading, nope, NOT US.\r\nAnyways, unrelated, but please send\r\nhelp and money to our gofundme.\r\n\r\n\r\n**AY, AY! LOCAL MAGAZINE UNDER PFETA FIRE**\r\n\r\nRecently, a local CMU satire\r\nmagazine has come under fire from\r\nPFETA, the slightly more radical\r\nversion of PETA, for using the\r\nendangered aye­ayes to help write\r\narticles. When asked to comment,\r\nthe editor­in­chief has denied all\r\nclaims of any animals being used to\r\ncreate and distribute the magazine.\r\nHe says that, “I absolutely did not\r\nbuy mysterious monkeys from some\r\nguy in a shady alley.\" PFETA has\r\nstated they will storm the university\r\nto find the lemurs and will use force\r\nif necessary. If anyone has seen a\r\ncreepy looking lemur thing, PFETA\r\nis urging students to contact them\r\nimmediately. However, we at readme\r\nstrongly advise against this action\r\nfor the safety of the university\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n\r\n**TROUBLE IN PARADISE, ILLEGAL TRAFFICKING**\r\n\r\nMysterious persons were\r\ndiscovered at the Pittsburgh\r\nInternational Airport transporting\r\nsome mysterious animals. When the\r\nTSA discovered this, the mysterious\r\npersons apparently made a break for\r\nit. Apparently they got away and the\r\nairport is having difficulty\r\nidentifying said people because of\r\nthe fake nature of the passports and\r\noverly black clothing. The airport\r\nalso claims that the mysterious\r\nanimals were some kind of monkeys\r\nand probably illegal. The airport is\r\nnow looking for any information\r\nregarding these monkey smugglers.\r\n\r\n\r\n**ILLEGAL AIRCRAFT CREATES EVEN MORE SUSPICION**\r\n\r\nA shoddily built aircraft made\r\nfrom cardboard and aluminum was\r\nfound broken down in the Cut of\r\nCMU. It was painted with the logo\r\nof a certain satire magazine but the\r\nmembers have denied any\r\nassociation with the aircraft. This\r\nabomination of an aircraft had also\r\nbeen spotted in the skies of Africa\r\nand the Atlantic Ocean. Authorities\r\nare suspicious that the magazine not\r\nonly built the aircraft but also flew\r\nit illegally. No word has come from\r\nthe editor­in­chief as supposedly he\r\nhas a bad case of sea and motion\r\nsickness as well as food poisoning\r\nand a lack of sleep. We here at\r\nReadMe hope he gets better as it’s a real shame he’s sick and all.",

    "body": "{{Copy_of_farnam_Lg5dsQU.png}}\r\n\r\nIn the days following README's bankruptcy, many questions have arisen, such as \"how,” \"why,” and \"what's the difference between a marmot and a gopher.” The answer to at least two of these questions has recently come to light: Farnam's hair. It is still unclear why the hair of CMU's beloved president was sold in the first place, but it is now safely in storage in an undisclosed location on campus.\r\n\r\nBut just how much did it cost? Secret documents found stapled to the outside of Wean Hall identified the price as $5k per strand. \"I just don't see why we agreed to pay the same price for every hair,\" one student's diary entry read. \"Even the really short ones.\"  A campaign by many in the KGB sought to instead use units of cumulative length, volume, or mass. One physics student suggested surface area. They were promptly expelled.\r\n\r\nThe hair is currently in a quart-size Ziploc bag in a secret location in Doherty Hall, while readMe staff discuss next steps. Some have suggested trading the hair back to Farnam in exchange for emeralds, to make a small profit. Others insist on making sweaters for the rabbits on campus. \r\nFarnam, who was observed Tuesday wearing a conspicuously tall top hat, promised to use the funds for the construction of a large hot tub beneath Hamerschlag Hall. It will feature a large bronze statue of Andrew Carnegie himself. Readme has submitted a bid to purchase the bronze representation of Mr. Carnegie's beard hair, which is currently pending, subject to approval for a high-interest predatory loan in Eshaan's name.\r\n\r\nIndustrious as always, readme's journalists are considering several proposals to profit off the hair, which is stored in the unlocked second closet from the right in the mall-side hallway on floor B of Doherty's basement, two shelves up. Pitched ideas include \"compete with tortoise\", \"Farnam's locks sufficient to secure doors?\", and \"solve housing crisis\".",

    "body": "{{image1_xduEhgF.png}}\r\n\r\nAn unknown, century-long zoning conflict between Carnegie Mellon and the city of Pittsburgh has recently come to light in a particularly destructive way: the Fence, a CMU tradition harking back to the early days of the university, is to be demolished next Wednesday.\r\n\r\nOn November 31, 2023, municipal workers sorting through old zoning documents found the original paperwork submitted by Andrew Carnegie to buy the land which would eventually become Carnegie Mellon University. While looking over the historic document, they discovered a clerical error that meant the 32.78 by 15.659 foot rectangle of land around the Fence had never actually been purchased by Mr. Carnegie. Instead, the space was still owned by the city of Pittsburgh. The discovery set off months of intense legal battles between the city and CMU administration unwilling to part with the beloved campus landmark. However last Friday a judge ruled that the contentious plot was, in fact, the property of Pittsburgh. The city wasted no time to start planning construction.\r\n\r\nREADME spoke to dozens of students and faculty about the news, and emotions were high across the board. After approaching README journalists, student Eshaan Joshi stated “It’s the goddamn bureaucracy. The Man is always trying to beat you down. This is what’s wrong with democracy in America.” He wasn’t the only one hurt by the news. Another student, Isaac Williamson, was one of dozens of people watching the bulldozers roll in. “It’s like a part of me is missing,” he whispered as he wiped a tear from his eye. A common question from the student body was what would replace the fence. Danya Kogan was heard remarking “I feel like a 489.31 acre parking lot would go really well there.” Yet students and faculty weren’t the only ones upset: “What am I even paying tuition for?” asked Heather Rogers, the parent of a student at CMU. “I want my child to go to the best school possible. Without the Fence, Carnegie Mellon has nothing. I mean, who cares about robots?” Each interview revealed more and more the plummeting morale across campus.\r\n\r\nIt’s unclear what plans Pittsburgh has in store for the former home of the Fence. An insider source for README alleged that the city was planning to turn the space into the world’s smallest parking garage, however this is as of yet unconfirmed. README reached out to the city of Pittsburgh for an interview during the writing of this piece. The Man did not respond to our request by time of printing.",

    "title": "Feng Shui for ruining your life",
    "body": "Have you ever felt like you were doing too well in your classes? Do you wake up too well-rested? Feng Shui is an essential practice for balancing your energy, and can be easily manipulated to prevent you from reaching your full potential. With ReadMe’s expert advice, any standard three-person one-room apartment can be transformed into the soul-sucking hovel of your dreams.\r\n\r\nFirst, pick a building near an intersection with heavy traffic. Mudge, Morewood Gardens, and Residence on Fifth are all recommended locations. If you are living off campus, try to find an apartment complex that is also close to a stagnant pond and large, threatening buildings. Choose a room directly across from the elevators. This will cause difficulty in accumulating wealth, leave you more prone to accidents and medical emergencies, and create disharmony between you and your roommates. Ideally, the room’s bathroom should be on the leftmost side of the room and as close to the doorway as possible. Make sure there is a large window directly visible from the entrance so energy will leave the room as quickly as possible. If possible, renovate the apartment or dorm so that one of the corners is protruding with multiple sharp angles. This will create an irregularly-shaped living space. If renovation is not possible you can also use dividers to create a similar effect. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important elements in Feng Shui is bed position. Place your bed in the center of your doorway with the feet protruding into the hallway. Make sure there is no headboard. This ensures you are in the strongest possible funeral position and blocks the flow of energy into the room. A bright construction worklight should be used to fill your sleeping area with harsh light. Place a broken mirror near the upper-right corner of your bed and angle it such that you have an uninterrupted view of the toilet from both your bed and door. Inside the bathroom, place an aquarium of stagnant water. If there is not enough space, a full sink or bathtub will suffice. A few dead fish inside the aquarium are recommended but not necessary. If you want to go the extra mile, invite an evil spirit or two into your home. I hear they’re fans of ReadMe!\r\n\r\nProper balance between elements is vital when looking at your home’s Feng Shui. It is important to ensure your living space is following the most destructive cycle of elements: metal, wood, earth, water, and fire. By placing the elements in this each one will weaken the next, successfully removing any benefits they may have otherwise created. The placement of elements in the room is less important than the order and exact furniture location may be modified. This article will start with metal and move clockwise through the room for each successive element. \r\n\r\nStarting with metal, place metal exercise equipment in the far-left corner of the room. Large 300 pound dumbbells are an easy option, as is a metal pullup rack. For wood, set a wooden desk directly in front to the right wall at a slight diagonal towards the far-right corner. Place a wooden bunk bed behind the desk. This will ensure lots of movement behind your back as you work. Next, place a large number of dead cacti on top of your dresser. This will satisfy the earth requirement while simultaneously increasing stress and conflict. The cacti will also invite bad energy, stagnation, and decay into your living space. If you’re worried the cacti won’t be enough, grow a colony of black mold on the wall closest to the door. Finally, add a couple more bowls of standing water in the bathroom to satisfy the water element and complete the cycle.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have successfully used the power of Feng Shui to ruin your life. By following this guide, you can feel at ease knowing that you live with nothing but bad energy. And hey, at least it still won’t be as bad as Donner.",

    "title": "Feng Shui to make you forget them",
    "body": "{{fengshuiheader.png}}\r\n\r\nEveryone’s been there at some point or another: She left and took the house and the kids, he suddenly ghosted you after texting you “Love you, sweet dreams” the evening before, or you find from their friend that they were not into you it’s just that  you were there at the right time and place. You can still revel in the aftermath, you poor single soul, because not all hope is lost. At least not for your mental health, because in today’s guide, README will teach you how to use classical Chinese interior design techniques to reclaim the space the two of you used to share.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to take the time  to understand Feng Shui, a luxury they never extended to you. Feng Shui is an analysis of the placement of objects relative to each other so as to understand the effects of the Qi, or “energy” that spiritually inhabits all objects. The concept of Qi goes back to the earliest examples of Taoist texts about how to cultivate Qi for better health and longevity. It is often claimed that Feng Shui, when done well, can enhance one's connection to the world and reduce stress and anxiety. These tips will help consolidate all the positive Qi back into your life, or at least give you something to do that isn't getting drunk and begging to be taken back:\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 1 - Never Hang Mirrors Across from the Front Door</b>\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple: Any good energy that comes across your threshold will immediately get reflected back outside. Of course this may depend on what energy lies outside, for example, using mirrors in hallways that greet a serene landscape may pull that peaceful energy into the home. But you live in America, which means you are invariably facing a major road, so block out that chaotic noisy energy by removing any mirrors from the thresholds outside.\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 2 - Never Put a Bedroom Over a Garage</b>\r\n\r\nGarages have heavy, chaotic energies. And that is the last thing you want to feel when it comes to rest. In Feng Shui, a garage is beneficial because it represents bringing resources into the home, but it is not ideal to have a bedroom over a garage. It is a big, open, empty space with not a lot of life energy in it, which can leach into your bedroom, making your bed feel big, open and empty.\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 3 - Treat Your Stove Like Your Most Prized Possession</b>\r\n\r\nStoves are important in Feng Shui—they bring good fortune and attract abundance. The stove represents household wealth. Even if you never cook, try to use it periodically and all its burners. Keep yours clean and use food to fill that hole in your stomach.\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 4 - Ban Electronics in the Bedroom</b>\r\n\r\nThey’re not gonna text you back. It’s not happening.\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 5 - Never Place Beds in Direct Alignment with Doors</b>\r\n\r\nIt is best not to be directly in line with the door to your bedroom. Having your bed in a good position is one of the Feng Shui fundamentals. Place your bed so you can see the door while lying down without being directly in line with it; this is the optimal placement. This brings ease and restfulness because it allows you to see what is coming at you, both literally and figuratively, and gives foresight to predict another “we need to talk” text.\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 6 - Declutter</b>\r\n\r\nClutter is super destructive to a home and its occupants, especially when it overwhelms you from the moment you walk in the door. From a Feng Shui perspective, clutter is a “block” or an “impasse”, and the Qi cannot flow properly. Removing clutter can be a way to get the energy moving, especially if you feel stuck, and removing their things from your home helps stop reminding you of them whenever you see their items.\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 7 - Keep the Kitchen Table Clean</b>\r\n\r\nThis hub represents family and love; you want people to crowd around it and feel welcome. Keep it clean and available for gathering. This advice also extends past the kitchen table. Try balancing the energies of the kitchen with a vibrant green plant or by adding a bowl of oranges, which represent abundance\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 8 - Close Bathroom Doors When They’re Not in Use</b>\r\n\r\nTypically bathrooms radiate negative energy, which you do not want to circulate around the house. In addition, a lot of superstitions revolve around the flow of water, which can center the bathroom in the spiritual mind. Be sure to value water as the resource it is by fixing leaks and drips, and isolating your bathroom from the spirituality of the home by closing the door.\r\n\r\n<b>Tip 9 - Fill Forlorn Spots with Plants</b>\r\n\r\nWhether it’s a corner or a dark hall, seek out spots that feel stagnant and add the energy of happy green. They embody the energy of wood and can lift stagnant, stale Qi in a home. Now, plants do need sunlight, so be mindful of the type of plant you choose and where to place it. Afterall, how can you expect anything to thrive in an environment without warmth and care? The plant will try its best and be heartbroken when it just still isn't enough.",

One such rule is that so long as two people are \"holding\" the fence by staying within its encircling gravel pit, no others may lay claim to it.\r\n\r\nThis simplicity falls apart, however, when we consider complex edge cases in the definition of a human life. Perhaps the most fraught of these is the point at which a fetus can be counted as a person.\r\nCMU's Student Senate, which governs the Fence, recently issued a policy clarifying this matter. It simply reads, \"a fetus counts as a 'person' for the purposes of defending the Fence only if the fetus may plausibly survive independently outside the womb, which may be estimated at 24 weeks from conception.\" [Article II.D.6.a.ii]\r\n\r\nThis policy was roundly praised for its vision and specificity. \"I appreciate that we now have a firm answer,\" one student stated. \"I think all sides in this debate are now pleased.\"\r\n\r\nWhile no instance is known where the personhood status of a fetus was the deciding factor in a dispute over control of the Fence, the Senate's foresight in providing guidance on the issue is laudable. We can only hope that similarly prescient legislation may be adopted governing this author's intent to carry out illegal abortions within the gravel pit, using only technology which was available in 1923.",

    "body": "Welcome, dear one, to the last academic guide you will ever need. \r\n\r\nIn this trying season of finals and term projects – when time is short, energy wanes, and we remain besieged by our thanksgiving-fueled, Celsius-charged gut microbiomes – conventional academics are no longer viable. This compendium, brought to you after immense struggle and a dash of bloodshed with campus security, is your ticket through. Be warned all you heart-faint, law-abiding, and poorly-hydrated souls: these strategies are exhausting and cruel. But master them, and you will emerge from your exam rooms a conqueror. \r\n\r\n<b>Steal, steal, steal.</b> The treasure map to exams lies right under your nose: in lectures. Don’t restrict your exposure to material to a wan few hours a week. Whether you can sneak in a powerful laptop equipped with the most egregious of LaTex instances or a timeless relic of paper and pencil, extract every drop these sessions offer. Siphoning material busies the hands, engages the mind, and fills your vault of insights until the entire course is your accomplice in success.\r\n\r\nEven at this thirteenth hour, with lectures dwindling and exams encroaching, steal like your life depends upon it. Butter up your friends with a careful bribe – a kindly worded text – and their guard may slip, leaving their own carefully compiled information to your mercy. Slink into professors’ hours with sweet nothings of mostly informed questions, and they might unwittingly arm you with the cinching answers. Steal from online guides, antiquated Quizlets, Greek siblings if you can and Pitt comrades if you must. \r\nPiracy isn’t just a crime, but a divine path: for the proactive, the courageous, and the financially successful, it is the path to victory.\r\n\r\n<b>Keep friends close, and flakers closer.</b> University is not a garden party; it is a court of knives. We each must decide ourselves when to sheathe, when to brandish, and when to press steel (metaphorically, of course) to the throat of our peers. By now, group project pre-selection has passed, and ideally, you’ve secured honorable compatriots amongst the untrustworthy and the feckless. Yet for those less fortunate, shackled non-communicators, deadline-huggers, and other such chips on the wheel of progress, be unrelenting in your vigilance.\r\n\r\nHound your partners with ceaseless check-ins, draw them in with saccharine invitation to group work sessions. Feed them exciting updates and reassurances of grandeur. Many a “bad partner” need only guidance, structure, or an unmistakable – yet comforting – eye over the shoulder. Draw them in and hold them close, too tightly to escape your watch.\r\n\r\nBut when diplomacy falters – when your flaker retreats to the shadows of silence and hostility – you must prepare for war. \r\n\r\nKeep meticulous archives: document every ignored plea, every shattered deadline, every contribution or blinding lack thereof. Step boldly into their positions and cover their work: let effort sing of your sacrifice. Find absolution in your reliable teammates, or the overarching authority of your professors. With this, your adversary will find themselves entangled in a web of gutted alibis and dead promises, excised from the project that would have saved their grade.\r\n\r\nCome presentation day, stand tall. Watch your honest partners gleam and your adversary crumble to dust. This university is yours to conquer.\r\n\r\n<b>Hone your self to a bleeding edge.</b> This is the most critical of all. An empty vessel cannot pour, an empty basket cannot feed, and you can expend no healthy effort – to say nothing of besting finals – without being armed, stocked, and cared for.\r\n\r\nRest long and well. Sleep is not a luxury, but a whetstone; it relaxes the muscles, sharpens the mind, ensures you another fight and another victory. Sleep unabashedly and callously; obliterate any obstacles between you and your blankets. Let rest be the foundation of your strength.\r\n\r\nEat richly and with intent. Beyond mere sustenance, let food be a source of comfort and joy. Habitualists, savor familiar routines and the now-scarce relaxation they afford you. Experimentalists, let new tastes be a welcome reprieve from academic drudgery. Steal what pleasure you can, especially from these rituals of sustenance.\r\n\r\nCollude with friends. Breathe deep the cold air. Brutally arrange your schedule, and carve out inviolable pockets for your personal pursuits. Guard your pleasures, the spoils of your struggle.\r\n\r\nWith that, dear one, your training is complete. There is a world beyond the final, and with this, you will soar to it.",

    "body": "Pittsburgh itself is an incredibly unique city – near Ohio, but not Midwest, near Maryland but not Southern, near West Virginia, but most residents do not consider it Appalachian. We also have our own “accent insulate” here, as a consequence of Pittsburgh being settled during the time of the 13 colonies and the mountainous geography of the region. While the North and South have largely moved into the same “accent group”, Southwestern Pennsylvania prides itself on being different. The way of speech here combines morphosyntactic structures from Scotch-Irish (My car needs warshed, as opposed to my car needs washing), and has over a century of contact from Eastern and Southern European languages (The monophthongization of the MOUTH vowel, for example). The Allegheny mountains have isolated us, which only makes us more unique. \r\n\r\nLinguistics is not the only aspect of our city in which we are unique – our schools have some of the wackiest traditions in collegiate America, and since finals week is approaching, the better. The Dartmouth on the Monongahela, Carnegie Mellon University, offers a myriad of century-old traditions pertaining to the hellish finals week. The most prominent tradition here is known as Tartan Roulette. While this may seem like monetary gambling, which you can do at the poker club, it is a challenge to see if the student would even be able to see their final exams. In this 100+ year old tradition, a student goes to one of our on-campus dining locations just before a final, and asks the cashier to do Tartan Roulette. To the student two soups are presented – one is just regular chicken noodle soup (you can ask for a vegan option as well!), and the other is Perpetual 1-Day Blinding Stew. If the student chooses correctly, they will be taking their exam with a huge adrenaline rush, allowing them to perform significantly better. If you chose wrong, well then you’re fucked.",

    "title": "Easy Alternatives To Fixing Your Heater!",
    "body": "With the current weather conditions, it is important that everyone stays safe, and more importantly warm. However, when the heater has to be fixed seven times in one month– and still isn’t working– it might be time to look for alternatives. Heaters can be a bit out of the price range for many of us. Considering the heater will only be used for about another month or so, many of us can’t justify spending so much money! But, because staying warm is incredibly important, we here at ReadME have compiled a few cheap and easy ways to stay warm during the harsh winter!  \r\n\r\n<b>At-Home Sauna </b>\r\n\r\nJust turn on the bathroom faucets to hot and sit back on your porcelain throne. Eventually, the steam will act as a makeshift sauna. If you have a tub, sit in that instead. If you are using the tub, make sure you bring snacks and everything you need on a chair or small table. You’ll be staying in there for a while, getting out will be a fate worse than death! Be prepared to stake out the bathroom for as long as possible, even if you have roommates. While this solution is extremely easy, it may not be viable for everyone. If you pay for utilities, you will definitely incur severely high prices in the long run. Also, if you don’t have running hot water, this is not the method for you! \r\n\r\n<b>Feeling the Heat </b>\r\n\r\nAnother idea to try is using the power of hot food to warm you up. Spicy food will be the best for this trick. Simply get some hot sauce in your eyes, nose, and ears and let them sit for a few minutes! You’ll forget that bed is literally a sheet of ice because of how warm you feel. That and the fact you’ll be in excruciating pain. If it gets too unbearable, you can always call the ambulance and get to stay in the warmth of the ER- although your overnight hospital stay may also make you bankrupt. You may also lose the ability to smell, hear, and see. Oh well!\r\n\r\n<b>Fun Dorm Campfires </b>\r\n\r\nIf all else fails, a nice fire will warm you right up! If you have a butane stove, turn it on. A few minutes later, you will realize the icicles in your room are barely dripping. Not to worry because lighters and matches can be fairly cheap and available in many places. Alternatively,  get some dry sticks and start rubbing. Consider using up all your past notes, tests, and readings as kindling. If decent sized wood fuel is too hard to find this time of year, consider using your roommate’s things–anything large and flammable. However, be extremely mindful about setting off any sprinkler systems. If you get wet, that’ll just make you more cold! There is also a non-zero chance you burn your place down. To combat any excessive fire growth, be sure to have a fire extinguisher and a bucket-full of water on hand! If not, you may be facing  hefty fees and the extreme cold. \r\n\r\n<b>Leave!!! </b>\r\n\r\nThe final option is to simply not live at your place anymore. The demons of ice and snow have won. Crash the rest of the winter with a friend, colleague, even a sworn enemy. If you must, show up to Farnam’s doorstep and start to sob uncontrollably until he lets you in. If your chosen host declines, try begging even more pitifully. Or, stage a hostile takeover of their place. Maybe find refuge on campus. The HOA couches and chairs might be a good place to sleep. You could shower in the UC or Gates! Or, just live outside in a tent. Because the tent is much smaller, heat from your body can radiate more, making it much warmer than wherever you were living. Wherever you go, just get away from the icy hell that is your living situation.",

    "body": "I used to hate French people. As a young denizen of the internet, I spent time in circles that enjoyed ragging on the country and its citizens, and those sentiments festered into my own twisted anger at people I’d never even met. I jeered in history classes, bullied internet strangers, hell, once I bought a $6.95 flag just to burn it in my yard and spit on the ashes. You’d be forgiven for thinking a Frenchman baguette-shanked my childhood dog, the way I spoke of these people.\r\n\r\nOne family trip showed me otherwise. The moment I stepped off the train in Lyon-Part-Dieu, I was inescapably immersed in a world of kindness and generosity. Goodness me, every coffee house patron, every polyglot museum tour guide, even (especially) the old farmer grandparents who sat us down for dinner in their own home. I get misty thinking of them, how warm they were to a family of strangers with a misguided teenager in tow. I had been taught to hate this name, this concept of a people, and the whole nation of human beings I directed my ire at still took me in with open arms. It took three days to prove everything I thought I’d known for the last five years wrong.\r\n\r\nTo French people, I deeply apologize. I regret how much of my life I’ve devoted to baseless hatred of your beautiful, grand, welcoming country. My tirades were insensitive and disrespectful, coming from a place of willful misunderstanding, and for all that, I am sorry. And in coming to this awareness, I’ve been incredibly privileged to learn so much more about myself, and about you all, and that has taken me to a very special place of understanding. If there is one lesson about the human condition to take from this editorial, let it be this:\r\n\r\nParisians fucking suck.\r\n\r\nI’m sorry I ever sullied the name of France with those motherfuckers. On that trip I had the great misfortune of taking “just one afternoon stop, because we have to” in Paris. From about three hours there, I discarded my misguided, directionless hate for a revitalized and healthily educated one. They are unfathomably rude, disrespectful of all other lifeforms, and all guilty of never having given up that French aristocracy they obviously dearly miss. I’m so proud for having grown up, for having found the true people who deserve my ire. Old Farmer Gérard, may your days be peaceful. Everyone else, let’s party like it’s 1789.",

    "title": "Funny Pranks We Legally Can't Tell You To Pull During Carnival",
    "body": "Pulling pranks is great, just yesterday I pulled a hilarious prank where I put opioids in a guy’s beer. With Carnival leading to all kinds of people being out and about on campus, it's the perfect time for a little fun. But maybe you’re tired of the same old boring schtick of screaming “FIRE” or yelling at hungover people through a megaphone. Not to worry, for the past thousand years I have been honing myself in the art doing a little trolling. So, let me tell you some of my favorite gags and gaffs to pull at Carnival.\r\n\r\nFirst is a classic, the SWAT call. It’s incredibly easy to pull off: call 911, say that someone has a bomb and is threatening to blow up the university, pretend to panic, hang up, then grab some popcorn and watch. Pretty quickly (depending on how many other pranks are occurring that day), there’ll be a full SWAT team, armed and ready to kill on sight. After enjoying watching everyone freak out for a bit, you can inform them it was “just a prank bro.” That automatically acts as a legal Get Out of Jail Free Card, so you can just laugh along with everyone about your funny joke - no harm, no foul. I personally have pulled this prank on friends, neighbors, churches, lemonade stands, and my high school before I was expelled. So I can guarantee it'll always land.\r\n\r\nIf you really want people to have their eyes on you, streaking is THE tried and true method. Doing this is even easier than a SWAT call: just take off all your clothes and run faster than CMUPD. This is guaranteed to draw the eyes of roaming students, alumni, parents, and children at Carnival, who’ll all be mesmerized by the hilarity of your joke. I can personally attest that the sight of someone running from CMUPD in their birthday suit always draws laughs. It’s a prank that can be enjoyed by everyone, some enjoying much more than others. Concerned about revealing yourself to not be very well-endowed? No worries, just get absolutely wasted; that always solves my self-confidence issues. Last year I did this at my local Elementary school and everyone loved it. They all couldn't stop screaming with laughter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you really want to get an emotional reaction though. This isn't something I personally enjoy, but all you sadists may derive great pleasure from this. You've all probably seen those videos where people ask other people to do challenges, and then they reward them with large amounts of money for completion. Then there’s also some tear jerking bit about how the money will change their lives or whatnot. So, what you do is that you give them some really difficult to complete challenges (run a mile under ten minutes, walk across burning coals, etc.). Then when they finish, you bounce. Either just don't give them money or, if you're really sinister, just give them fake money to still get that emotional reaction. It’ll be just like those fake challenge videos online, except this time only the money is fake.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last prank I can tell you about is a time honored CMU tradition, gazorching. Don't know what gazorching is, just ask any member of staff or alumni; I'm sure they'd be happy to tell you. There isn't even a requirement to use water; I’ve found paint, hydrofluoric acid, mustard gas, agent orange, and radon to all be easy to obtain and extra effective as ammo. Gazorching already has the bonus of being a world-famous thing, so no one will be upset at all. So go and gazorch all over the place! (This article was paid for by CMU Advocates for Gazorching)",

While the couples' finances have since been settled, CMU has quietly ignored a brewing custody battle over the Gates' favorite child: the Gates-Hillman Center.\r\n\r\nWhile the 9-story building was conceived by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2009, which is around the time Bill first became friends with Jeffrey Epstein, the Bill Gates Foundation and the Melinda Gates Foundation have since parted ways. They can no longer legally support the same causes, and that includes raising the young Gates Center, which turns 16 this fall.\r\n\r\nCMU has had to step in as an impartial mediator. Farnam had strong opinions on the issue, and quickly decided that custody would go to the Melinda Gates Foundation. The building is now to be called the Melinda Gates Center. Hillman has been dropped from the name, though his influence still remains in the building's acronym, which will remain GHC (though it is now short for \"Glasgow Haskell Compiler\").\r\n\r\nMelinda French Gates has stated she has plans for the building now that it is fully under her control. For one, she plans to destroy the spiral, which she states \"reminds [her] of Bill's penis.\" The classrooms in the center tower of the spiral will remain in use, but students must now jump across a chasm to get to class.",

Tears streamed down the face of the little gay nutcracker. Was he unlovable? Was he destined to be alone? Was this all a cruel joke from a heartless creator?\r\n\r\nThe little gay nutcracker sat alone on the cold, barren warehouse rack – until he wasn’t. One day a Target worker entered carrying a box of Christmas nutcrackers. The worker placed the box of Christmas nutcrackers on a shelf across from the little gay nutcracker. As the weeks, went by the box of nutcrackers slowly dwindled, until only one sad nutcracker remained at the bottom of the barren box. Christmas came and went, and no one claimed the lonely nutcracker. \r\n\r\nIn early January, a Target worker moved the sole nutcracker next to the little gay nutcracker, to make room for Valentine’s inventory. The little gay nutcracker did not notice this new acquaintance at first, as he had fully dissociated into the void. Until, one day, he felt a smooth wooden arm brush across his back. “Hey” a kind voice said. The little gay nutcracker turned his head towards the sound, in front of him was the man of his dreams. Tall, blond, and drop-dead gorgeous. The little gay nutcracker began to blush: perhaps a higher power had heard his wishes. “My name’s Friedrich,” mustered the little gay nutcracker. “That’s a pretty name,” replied the other nutcracker. “I’m Ludwig.”\r\n\r\nFriedrich and Ludwig spent every second with each other. When the warehouse closed for the night, they would ride the Barbie cars through the floor and talk the entire night. They had pillow fights in the home decor aisle, movie nights in the tech display. Friedrich tried to fight back his feelings for Ludwig but he couldn’t deny his heart pounding in his chest. Everytime he looked into Ludwig’s eyes, he saw forever.\r\n\r\nFinally, Friedrich could no longer take it. While Ludwig was asleep, Friedrich snuck into the LEGO aisle and grabbed the largest flower set he could find. He worked the entire night to build a beautiful bouquet of roses for Ludwig. At the end of the night, he snuck back onto the shelf with Ludwig and carefully hid the flowers behind a box of candy canes. When Ludwig woke up, Friedrich knew what he had to do. He grabbed the flowers, got down on one knee and asked “Ludwig, will you be my boyfriend?” \r\n\r\n“YES!” Ludwig said, pulling his own set of flowers out from behind him. “I was just going to ask you that.” The two nutcrackers hugged and kissed. They had each other, and that was all they needed.",

    "title": "Gender euphoria: humorless humping",
    "body": "Gender Dysphoria is the concept of one’s gender identity within oneself clashing with their perceived or performed gender presented to the outside world. This is a common phenomenon,  particularly in the trans and non- binary communities, where this  dissonance causes intense discomfort. Common triggers for dysphoria include improper pronoun use, wearing clothing that misaligns with an individual’s gender identity, defining gendered features that contrast one’s identity, and seeing oneself in the mirror/ photos (amongst many others). Gender is a social construct built around societal roles, expectations, and precedents for various demographics. When trans people are faced with triggers that typically align with their sex assigned at birth, or directly contrast their gender identity, dysphoria occurs. With gender roles being so nuanced in modern society, researchers have delved into the minutia of these dynamics. A recent study conducted by Carnegie Mellon’s psychology department has highlighted a direct link between one’s humoristic abilities and the relative dysphoria incurred.\r\n\r\nIt’s common knowledge that women are not funny. Between royal fools, comedy playwrights, stand­up comedians, and even workplace banter, humor has always been a man’s job. Given that humor is so blatantly aligned with masculinity, research has shown that trans women experience unprecedented levels of dysphoria when viewed as funny. After several experiments, studies have demonstrated that the more raucous the laughter following a trans woman’s statement is, not only is she more likely to experience dysphoria, but the dysphoria she experiences will be more intense than the typical bouts. One subject stated, “They had a group of us in a room and we were told to crack jokes. When people laughed at what I was saying, I became acutely aware of my penis. The fact that they viewed me as someone intelligent enough to devise wit and produce effective comedy was disheartening because they clearly didn’t view me as a real woman.”\r\n\r\nGender euphoria, conversely, is the feeling of elation that one experiences when their gender identity is affirmed. A secondary study dove into this concept and found an interesting statistic. Women have historically had to  deal with subpar sexual experiences, whether it be due to poor performance on their partner’s behalf, stigma and guilt surrounding sexual topics and behavior, and a host of other factors. As a result, a common aspect of a woman’s sexual journey is faking orgasms. This study found that faking orgasms brings trans women extreme levels of gender euphoria. Subjects have reported that they “feel validated by being displeased in bed” and that “faking an orgasm makes [them] feel just like a real woman” which leads researchers to believe this could be a massive breakthrough in the field. \r\nScience is always looking to improve the world, whether it be through innovating technology, providing a better understanding of the world, reducing the harm in our communities, and more. These studies are at the cutting edge of LGBTQ+ research in order to improve the experiences of our queer peers. With the new discoveries these researchers have unearthed, we now have new ways to do so. The teams that have worked on these studies posit that for the betterment of the trans community, we need to foster more environments where our trans women can both laugh and cum less.",

    "title": "Following surprise come-from-behind campaign, George Michael announced as U.S. President Elect",
    "body": "{{GeorgePresElectadded.png}}\r\nIn a landslide victory, George Michael has successfully secured his victory in the 2024 Presidential Election. This marks the first time a third-party candidate has ever won a presidential election in United States History. Michael is also the first animal to reach the position of Commander in Chief since Garfield’s election in 1880. Michael’s triumph over his human opponents signals a radical shift in the US political landscape; with a record-breaking 1,674% voter turnout yesterday, it’s clear that the American public is tired of the contemporary political landscape they find themselves in. Below, ReadME has outlined some three major policies Michael campaigned on in the weeks before the election:\r\n\r\n**Free Treats for All**: Michael has promised every US citizen over the age of 18 a stimulus package of 10 MilkBones, with families receiving an additional 5 treats per child. Campaign officials have stated that this will boost morale in an ever-doomerist American public. Additionally, Michael has promised that this package will be the first in a step of economic actions taken to revitalize the US economy.\r\n\r\n**Invisible Border Fence**: Michael has promised to partner with Invisible Fence to build an electric border wall between the United States and Mexico. Officials state that this would both prevent illegal immigration while ensuring that US citizens living nearby wouldn’t have to reflect on what such exclusionary policies mean for their own senses of morality. Though this new border fence would require forcibly fitting every Mexican citizen with electric collars, Michael argues that he has found a solution that benefits all parties involved: instead of Mexico, Sweden would be forced to pay all related costs.\r\n\r\n**PAW Patrol**: Upon taking office, Michael has made it clear that one of his first actions as president will be to institute the Patriot Assurance Wardens(PAW) Patrol. This special police force would monitor un-American activity in the US and suppress any activities that could possibly threaten the legitimacy of the President. Though Michael has not clarified what such “un-American” activities would look like, insider information given to ReadME hints that the PAW Patrol would mostly target excessive vacuum use, wrongful bathtime, and questioning a dog’s capability to be president.\r\n\r\nGeorge Michael’s new term will certainly change the future of politics in America, and other non-human have already begun to campaign for office. As Michael often asserts, “Ain't no rules says a dog can't be president”.",

    "title": "Fact Checking The Gettysburg Address",
    "body": "With the election season reaching its apex, I have found it necessary to untangle some of the webs of misinformation that have been weaved through underhanded political campaigns. At the forefront of this country's greatest deception is none other than the highly esteemed so-called “honest” Abe.\r\n\r\nThat’s right! If one were to simply unpack the “arguments” of former president Abraham Lincoln, one would be disgusted to find an abundance of deceit and trickery littered throughout even the most mundane of speeches. Therefore, I will now proceed to reveal to you a small fragment of his chicanery by meticulously analyzing the famous Gettysburg address:\r\n\r\n“Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation” - Now this address was given on November 19th, 1863 and the Declaration of Independence was signed on August 2nd, 1776. It does not take a mathematician to see that Lincoln was over 3 months off in his conclusions on America’s founding. Despicable.\r\n\r\n“dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” - One can quite easily note that 50% of all men are above average male height while 50% of men are below average height. This is clear evidence that not all men are created equal.\r\n\r\n“Now we are engaged in a great civil war” - While Lincoln delivered this speech, his audience was not participating in war as they were busy listening to a speech.\r\n\r\n“testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure” - At this period in time, one could not simply test a nation’s ability to endure as the College Board had not yet approved of such a standardized assessment.\r\n\r\n“We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live.” - It is quite likely that none of the soldiers who died in Gettysburg did so willingly, seeing as most of them would have wished to survive. This insinuation by Lincoln is extremely insensitive to the deceased and their families.\r\n\r\n“The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here” - This is just objectively incorrect. The Ghettiesburg address is one of the most popular presidential addresses and is still remembered to this day. \r\n\r\n“It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.” - None of those who had attended the Gettysburg address are currently alive to continue the Civil War.\r\n\r\n“that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain” - Over 28 thousand confederate troops died in the battle of Gettysburg, all of which were in vain.\r\n“and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” - Lincoln clearly misrepresents the composition of America’s government as it is not run by the people. It is run by politicians.\r\n\r\n\tIt is my hope that this analysis has enlightened you to the deeply sown deceit in our political system. It is my firm belief that in exposing the treachery in our politics, we as Americans can forge a new political atmosphere founded upon truth, justice, and a deep hatred of the Lincoln estate.",

While their alleged offenses varied widely in scale and execution, they all constituted some form of unauthorized aid, traced back to a single student who passed the course with a C last semester. Most significantly, none of the students involved showed any desire to receive assistance on the midterm.\r\n\r\nThe aid arrived in many different forms. Some thirty students received copies of Tuesday's midterm in their CMU Gmail inbox the night before, with personalized notes. Others were given assistance during the test itself: the student providing aid was caught no less than 13 times staring directly at a terrified student in the lecture hall, aggressively blinking in morse code. Several more students entered the test with detailed course notes written on their hands or arms, which they consistently denied writing themselves. \"I just woke up with this written on me,\" one concerned AIV recipient stated.\r\n\r\nWith over 90% of the class having received unauthorized and undesired assistance, just 9 students remain. They report a frightening atmosphere both in and out of the class, due to an ever-present threat of unwanted help with their coursework. One student reported changing her route to her apartment, after a masked figure jumped out of the shadows and began reciting homework answers. Another classmate returned to Michigan over the break to find his bedroom window shattered, the culprit being a brick with a note tied to it containing a printed copy of the upcoming final.",

This begets the question, is there any semblance of truth to this claim? We analyzed hundreds of years worth of financial literature as well as statistics, and even ended up interviewing both awake and asleep people to help us answer this very important question. What we found was that people who are awake spend their money on various goods and services², while people who are asleep spend virtually none³ (Or at least the sleeping people we interviewed refused to answer). This is because they are sleeping, and we cannot possibly stress how notably not-awake they are. Literature shows a strong correlation between spending money and declaring financial bankrupcy⁴ (Of course financial fraud exists and you can spend all of your friend’s money if you wanted to, but that does not count as them consciously choosing to gamble their savings away). Hence, we conclude that \"going woke\" makes one more likely to \"go broke\".\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\n1: I’m not racist, but I hate minorities, Tucker Carlson, 2023\r\n\r\n2: We made up this thing called money, Su Merriam, 5000 BC\r\n\r\n3: Money-spending statistics of REM-stage sleepers, Austin S.

All of the confiscated coal is to then be sent to fossil fuel energy facilities around the states they are seized from. \r\n\r\nThe Department of Energy is hopeful for the high yields in energy that can be gained by seizing this much coal, and there are rumored preparations to create a new “Burn the Flags of Non-US Countries Challenge” to hopefully increase the number of naughty kids to take coal from in 2025.",

With one of the best computer science programs in the world, a booming arts scene, and plenty of ways to engage its students, it’s no wonder CMU has such a strong reputation. Not only is this school academically challenging, providing students with adequate rigor to keep them at the forefront of innovation, but it also offers a beautiful campus. With unique sprawling buildings, open walkways, the iconic fence traditionally painted by students, and a library that lights up with rainbow colors at night, Carnegie Mellon is truly a spectacle. One of its proudest features is the expansive lawns. Between the Cut (the main lawn in the front of campus), the CFA Lawn, the Mall, and more, there’s no shortage of greenery to enjoy.\r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon spends roughly $80k on maintaining the grass on campus annually. To many’s dismay, the school has announced that they will be removing all the grass on campus due to a lack of funding in the budget. Students have been speculating that this poor budgeting is due to the expulsion of a former student in the class of 2025 for the use of racial slurs directed at university president Farnam Jahanian. With tuition at the school also being $80k, the working theory is that one student on campus is exclusively responsible for maintaining the grass. With this student having been expelled, CMU can no longer fund the lawns on campus. In the announcement, President Jahanian mentions “CMU is opting for a more industrial look to honor Andrew Carnegie’s steel empire and pay homage to the values of our founder”. With the call to school values, one can’t help but wonder if this is a potential dig at the expelled student so flagrantly violating the code of conduct set at the university.\r\nDue to the imminent removal of the grass, several distinct groups have formed on campus, each with their own distinct philosophies. The first of these groups, the “CMU Green Lights,” adamantly opposes the removal of the grass. Members have staged protests involving chaining themselves to blades of grass to prevent the inbound landscaping. A second group, the “Lawnmowers,” is in full support of campus adopting a greyer aesthetic. These students have contacted the local steel mills in an effort to expedite the process, hoping to have a fully grey campus by early 2025. \r\n\r\nA third, much smaller group, actually doesn’t care about the fate of the grass on campus. These students have focused on the matter of the expelled student. This group takes issue with the way the situation with the student was handled, arguing that he should not have been expelled to begin with, ultimately avoiding the controversy surrounding the grass. One student suggests: “Mark was a fine student with nothing but care in his heart. The intense passion he put into the upkeep of his gun collection and honoring the tradition of his family (gesturing towards a confederate flag) shows how dedicated Mark was to his community. He was always prim and proper, making sure his sheets stayed extra white and always ironing them so they were as pointy as can be, not a wrinkle in sight. To imagine he was ejected from this school instead of one of those affirmative-action, spot-stealing minorities is a disgrace.”",

    "body": "Congrats! You just picked up the keys to your second home. Time to turn this place into the <s>shittiest</s> slightly below average college house of some wannabe frat bro’s dreams. Here are readmE’s patented tips to get your place ready for some fresh faced college douchebags. \r\n\r\nTip 1: Your new home might have several maintenance issues, chipped paint, or a kitchen faucet that is held on by a stick of gum and one nondenominational prayer. DO NOT REPAIR THIS. Many tenants will complain about the so-called “landlord special” of painting over problems instead of properly addressing them. To avoid your tenants hating you for landlord-specialing over any problem, simply do not address any problem at all. Ever. In fact, don’t even step foot into your new property. By not looking at any problem you don’t actually have to fix it. The biohazards can’t hurt you if you never actually enter the house.\r\n\r\nTip 2: Many college students may complain that their landlord is overbearing. You can easily avoid this problem by including nothing in the lease. Keep your lease as minimal as possible to avoid having to pay for things like “mold damage” or “moveout cleans”. Your tenants will be secretly grateful because you could have included things in your lease such as “no cars more than 8 years-old on the property”. In fact, by simply not including anything in the lease, your tenants should really be tipping you 5-10% of their rent every month. \r\n\r\nTip 3: Do not respond to anything ever. Your second home is a perfect free money maker. If you have to do things like calling a plumber or electrician, your 100% profit margins will take a dip. ReadMe recommends keeping your phone constantly on do not disturb. Your tenants should not be able to contact you for any reason whatsoever. If your tenants start calling you to make you deal with the horrible plumbing or piles of trash left behind from previous tenants, simply throw your phone into a river. If that does not work and your tenants show up in person, pretend to not speak English. Readme recommends learning a few phrases in German to really sell this performance. \r\n\r\nTip 4: If none of these tips work and your tenants are insistent that you deal with any of the numerous issues on your property, we recommend dealing with one issue and then completely disappearing off of the face of the planet for 2-4 months. Your tenants should be so grateful that you handled the active biohazards in the second floor bathroom, that you shouldn’t have to address the live high-voltage wire hanging off of the porch for at least a few months.",

    "body": "Welcome to CMU, class of 2029+. When you first step onto campus, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the staggering number of clubs to join and people to meet, but if you're anything like us at readme, your first priority will always be one thing: sleeping with freshmen.\r\n\r\nWe've used our decades of collective experience to compile CMU's most comprehensive guide to getting in the kilt of the nearest warm body on campus. You can trust you're getting the real deal: for the 10th year in a row, the Wall Street Journal has ranked us as having more staffers \"drowning in pussy\" than any other magazine in the country. By the time you finish this brief article, you'll be drowning in it like a Navy SEAL at boot camp. You'll wake up resuscitated on the floor coughing up sex juices like it's pool water from a child's lungs on cold concrete in November. So sit down, put away your notebook, and strap in to strap on.\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll want to consider men. Drop the bar to the ground, and you'll have other things dropping not too long after. To any woman, dear reader, you're like a 2. But to a man, you're something like a 7, maybe higher if he's desperate. And look at him, he is.\r\n\r\nSecond, go for graduate students. Trust me, they're totally into you. Did your TA make eye contact? She wants you bad. Is your lecturer still pursuing a PhD? They're looking for just the right kind of distraction. If you catch someone over 22 out and about on campus, shoot your shot. Don't even be subtle with it, you both know what you're here for.\r\n\r\nThird, carry condoms at all times. You want them in your pockets, on your desk, and spilling out of your backpack. Nothing gets people turned on in an 8 AM lecture like seeing a little strip of foil-wrapped goodies sitting on the floor by your shoe, and that's when you make your move. Plus, it'll be reassuring to those around you to know that you're shielding others from the STDs you're carrying. If you don't have any condoms on you, just walk into the nearest 122 office hours and tell them you need sexual health supplies.\r\n\r\nIn this day and age, it may seem impossible to find mind boggling amounts of sex on a college campus, but with a little skill, you'll be sleeping around like the best of them. But if none of these tips work, become a TA for a difficult class and desperate almost-failures will be all over you.",

    "title": "SCC To Begin Enforcing Hays Code on Midway",
    "body": "{{scottyhays.png}}\r\nAs booth organizations begin to design their booths for the 2025 Spring Carnival, Spring Carnival Committee has announced a controversial new slate of regulations for the upcoming semester. In a press release emailed out to all booth chairs SCC required all booth designs to comply with Hollywood’s 1934 Hays Code. The email stated that booth was an art form in its own right, and as such had a “moral obligation and imperative to instill the correct morals in those who visit.” All booth themes will be resubmitted for secondary review. If a theme fails to meet the new requirements it will be discarded and the organization will have up to three days to submit a second theme. \r\n\r\nTo comply with the Hays Code, booths must be themed after movies which meet its criteria. Films with morally-gray characters of any kind are banned, as are depictions of crime, violence, homosexuality, and any implications of marital affection. Men and women are not allowed to be working on a booth at the same time, as building a house together conjures images of homemaking and domesticity. Such homemaking implies the existence of a relationship, and intrinsically implies the existence of sexual relations. Builders of the same gender, however, are similarly banned from working together due to the implications of homosexual relationships. Thus, only one person may work on a booth at a time.\r\n\r\nAccording to SCC, children who attend Spring Carnival are particularly susceptible to violent imagery. Booth organizations are allowed to choose movies with up to a cup of blood shown on screen. The yearly Stever Fight Club booth, alongside the yearly Teardown Bloodletting, will be banned from this year’s Carnival. Organizations will also be prohibited from passing out illicit substances as their game’s prize. Games are no longer allowed to teach participants how to commit various crimes, or to be generally unpleasant in any way.\r\n\r\nEnforcement of the Hays Code will come from the Booth Un-American Activities Committee. Organizations who violate the Hays Code will be subject to different levels of fines depending on the severity of the infraction. Extreme violators will be summoned to testify before the BUAC to answer questions about their actions and/or political affiliations. Those found guilty of being commie scum will be removed from Midway and imprisoned in the Wean prison cells for a minimum of one week. Investigations into the moral decay of Spring Carnival have already begun, with Scotty himself, the booth chairs of the CMU KGB, and four random students of vaguely eastern-european descent being called before BUAC in what is being called the Tartan 10. An anonymous source has informed READme that political purges have already begun within SCC and are expected to spread through other organizations. ReadMe is currently investigating rumors of an “April Revolution” being planned by the CMU KGB in protest of the new regulations, and we encourage readers to follow this story to ensure their carnival weekend is morally acceptable.",

In addition, whoever winds up guessing the right password will be given a bonus.\r\n\r\nAttached to this listing is a picture of the contents of the safe taken four years ago, as evidence that the nest egg does exist.

    "body": "Do you have an important exam coming up and cannot tolerate interruptions? Worry not, using these suggestions and your creativity you won’t ever have to worry about a roommate getting in your way again.\r\n\r\nFor those unaware Home Alone is a heartwarming family movie about a young Jigsaw brutally torturing and mutilating two unsuspecting anti-plumbers who tried to enter his home. Taking inspiration from the traps in that classic you too can keep your roommate out from entering your dorm(or at least from entering your dorm again).\r\n\r\nThe first trap is a classic: the incinerating door handle. If your dorm is anything like mine, a metal door handle needs to be turned to open the door. The average college student is estimated to own at least two blow torches for crème brûlée, so heating one to cause a second-degree burn should be a cinch.\r\n\r\nIf that didn’t deter your roommate and they successfully entered your room, the next item would typically be the tacks or toy cars. However, your roommate would likely have shoes on. Thus, I recommend having a glue trap right at the entrance to remove the shoes. After that, a few rusty nails sticking up would be very cost-effective.\r\n\r\nLet’s suppose all that still hasn’t kept your surprisingly determined roommate out, trust me, I get it. Luckily there is one last trap I can draw inspiration from, the Tommy gun trap. However, if your roommate has made it this far it’s clear that either they’re a masochist or are just really determined to stop you from studying. Now, according to a quick Google search I did when 18 in Pennsylvania one can legally own a semi-automatic rifle. In addition, for the sake of plausible deniability, I have not bothered to look at the CMU housing rules. All I’ll say is that this has proven to be the most effective method of keeping my roommate out.\r\n\r\nOf course, these are only a few of the limitless ideas you can come up with. From personal experience, chlorine gas, electric shocks, and cyanide shampoos are all also effective approaches. Just remember, when an A is on the line, sometimes you have to put on your best slasher smile.",

As I was sashaying though campus, I noticed a poster for blood donation. Being a kind-hearted individual, I naturally signed up to donate my blood. \r\n\r\nWoefully, on that fateful day, tragedy struck. I was filling out the patient intake form, when I was hit with the dreaded question: have you had anal sex with another man in the past three months? I felt a single tear form in my eye. Unfortunately, every day for the past three months, I had been having copious amounts of gay sex. In fact, every day for the past year I have been having gay sex. \r\n\r\nWas this a punishment from a higher power? A message from God, punishing me for engaging in homosexual activities? The devil thanking me for joining the side of sin? A sick punishment from a divine gay soul for being a lowly bottom? I couldn’t believe this. Maybe the Christian protesters at pride were warning me. Did they divine this betrayal and try to save me?\r\n\r\nI feel a tear running down my face as I leave the clinic. Everyone in line sees me exiting with no bandage on my arm. They are all silently judging me. They think I’m a little baby who chickened out donating blood. Do they see the homosexual glint in my eyes, and know this was a punishment from God?\r\n\r\nMaybe this is the final straw, the final push to repent my life of homosexual sin. Give up this lifestyle, marry a woman, live in the suburbs, own a single family home with a white picket fence, have 1.8 children and golden retriever. Or I could just become a top.\r\n\r\n*Articles featured in readme are the opinions of the authors and in no way reflect the opinions of the organization at la holy shit we're publishing this crap?*",

    "title": "Booth Stuns CMU With Structural Anomaly",
    "body": "When Spring Carnival Committee began a routine structural check on what seemed to be an ordinary one-story booth, it certainly never expected to discover a scientific mystery that would stump even the greatest minds CMU has to offer. Yet that’s exactly what happened when SCC checked the booth built by Zampanò’s Literature club. During the structural check, it was discovered that the booth was a quarter inch bigger on the inside when compared to the outside.\r\n\r\nZLC’s booth, themed after the hit documentary The Navidson Record, seemed laughably simple upon first glance. The walls are painted pitch black and there is no game for visitors to play. Although ZLC finished their structural work notably quicker than other blitz organizations, work on the booth ceased immediately afterwards. Nearby clubs noted that they never actually saw ZLC members working on the booth: Benner Rogers, a student at CMU working on booth for the CMU KGB, stated that the walls “just seemed to come up on their own.” When questioned further, she explained that,\r\n\r\n“I’ve never seen anyone step foot on their plot, but every time I left and came back something would be different. First it was the floor being finished. Then, new walls would pop up and get sheathed. And the really, I mean really weird thing was that it was all pre-painted. Even the wall frames are black…” With an uneasy glance at the booth, she quickly added, \"I don’t like to look at it much.”\r\n\r\nWhen the discovery of the booth’s spatial anomaly was made, it was initially chalked up to human error. But for many, the explanation is far too little. Rogers is also dissatisfied with official explanations.\r\n\t\r\n“I saw them measure the floor nearly fifty times. It’s not human error. I know it’s not. Something is seriously wrong in there and someone needs to find out what.” \r\n\r\nDue to the controversy, CMU administration have temporarily closed ZLC’s booth for Carnival. A ZLC representative was not able to be located to comment.\r\n\r\nAuthor’s note: The night before this article was to be printed, Ms. Rogers sent me a letter. I have enclosed the text below in its entirety:\r\n\r\n<i>I did it. I finally went inside. And… the door is gone. I mean, it’s still there on the outside. But on the inside… on the inside it just continues. There’s just a hallway, just as black as the rest of the booth. I don’t know how far it goes. I was too scared to go any further. \r\n\r\nI’m going inside again tonight. I need to know what’s at the end. This house is calling to me. I’ll write back when I make it out alive.\r\n\r\nBenner Rogers </i>\r\n\r\nSince writing this letter, Benner Rogers has reportedly gone missing. If you have any information on her whereabouts, please call the CMU Police Department.",

    "body": "Humans are among nature’s most social animals. They are renowned for their group migrations, cooperative foraging, communal roosting, synchronous breeding aggregations, precise parent–offspring interactions, coordinated group defenses, and intricate territorial and courtship rituals. In these and other contexts, and indeed in most moments of their lives, humans’ capability to navigate complex social demands and relationships can tip the balance between health or sickness, between reproductive success or failure, between life or death. It is thus no surprise that humans have evolved sophisticated systems for mediating social interactions. Foremost among these are communication signals, most evident in humans as songs, calls, color patterns and postural displays. These can transmit information about a signalers’ status, motivations, and possible future actions, for sensory and cognitive processing by signal receivers. In general, signals provide benefits for both senders and receivers. Communication is, in essence, a glue that maintains the cohesion of human societies, and a currency that mediates sophisticated relationships within. Collected below are some common mating calls that have been observed.\r\n\r\n“I make 6 figures a year.”\r\n\r\n“I’m 6 feet tall, I swear.”\r\n\r\n“I’m a private equity investor.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s compare hand sizes.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not like other girls/guys.”\r\n\r\n“I’m so small and delicate/big and rugged.”\r\n\r\n“I’m really into the alt/goth scene.”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard of this thing called the blockchain?”\r\n\r\n“I do crossfit.”\r\n\r\n“I play Valorant/League of Legends, I’m actually going semi-pro.”\r\n\r\n“I have an AI startup in Silicon Valley.”\r\n\r\n“Have you heard of our lord and savior Jesus Christ?”\r\n\r\n“Are you lost little boy/girl?”\r\n\r\n“I have a 500 day streak of learning Japanese on Duolingo.”\r\n\r\n“You’re just like a brother/sister to me.”\r\n\r\n“What’s your snap?”\r\n\r\n[Unsolicited photograph of male genitalia]\r\n\r\n“I play the guitar.”\r\n\r\n“I’m really into military history.”\r\n\r\n“Our zodiac signs are compatible.”\r\n\r\n“Want to see my car?”",

Hunt was constructed in 1961, but it didn't have exterior lights until 2010, when people stopped gaybashing and everything went to shit. Hunt Library thinks it serves. It needs to stop trying to make Cunt Library happen. It's not going to happen.\r\n\r\nHunt hints at a fictional queer identity by flashing rainbow lights at night, in what appears to be a display of pride and flamboyance. But almost as soon as it starts, it turns back to white with blue corners, or sometimes blue with white corners, or sometimes solid piss yellow for some fucking reason.\r\nBut Hunt isn't gay, it knows it's not gay, Baker knows it's not gay, I know it's not gay, you know it's not gay, it led on my best friend. Hunt Library is a piece of shit for what it did to Pausch Bridge.\r\nQueerbaiting is primarily used by Hollywood to attract [I don't know if I can say this word] and their allies, without scaring the straights. Hunt Library is doing the same thing: it wants to have its cake and throw it back too. It's dishonest and honestly fucking shameful. I'd go talk to it but the De Fer unicorn makes me feel things I don't know how to process.\r\n\r\nAlso what the fuck is up with that high-pitched noise in Hunt on the first floor like can you not like bitch what. And who is Maggie Murph anyway??\r\n\r\nGay identity is not a commodity. I want to see Hunt Library go on a date with another library. I want to see them kiss. I want Hunt Library to look into its eyes as the realization hits that their relationship can never work out. I want to support Hunt Library through a heartbreak, bringing it soup and comforting it while it cries in its car during the 15 minute break it gets, begging it to eat just one bite of the sandwich it bought, because it's too weak to stand, and still has four hours to go. Hunt Library is a fucking coward, afraid to love, afraid to be loved. Hunt Library wasn't born this way. It's just too scared to confront the shit it's internalized, and too comfortable passing that on to others as a coping mechanism.\r\n\r\nHunt Library is a piece of shit, and I'm tired of saying it and nobody listening. Hunt Library is baiting us, while courting homophobes to keep the bubble it lives in from popping. It's a shallow friend and a cyberbully. Fuck Hunt Library.",

    "body": "Baker-Porter Hall is the most evil building on all of CMU’s campus. Its construction is proof of hell's existence. In order to graduate from the architecture program you have to successfully map Baker-Porter, no one’s done it yet. \r\n\r\nBaker-Porter cannot decide if it wants to be Baker or Porter. Where does Baker end and Porter start? No one knows. The hallway is so long by the time you reach the other end you lose your will to live. Baker-Porter consumes the entire South side of the mall, and we let it get away with it. Soon it will try to take over Hunt, then Ansys, then Scaife, then Hamerschlag, then Roberts, then Scott, and finally it will come for my precious Wean. Do we really want the Baker-Porter-Hunt-Ansys-Scaife-Hamerschlag-Roberts-Scott-Wean building? NO. If we do not act now it will already be too late. When you come back to campus as an alumni every building will be Baker-Porter. Carnegie Mellon University will be Baker-Porter university. Imagine saying that you graduated from Baker-Porter University– lame. This is the future Baker-Porter wants, and we should be scared.\r\n\r\nBaker-Porter wishes it was Wean. It will never be Wean. Baker-Porter will never have an ounce of Wean’s simplicity or tact. Baker-Porter is impossible to navigate. The walls on the A level of Baker are plastered with arrows directing you to rooms. There are very few rooms on Baker A, but the place is so terribly designed that massive amounts of signs are needed. Wean knows its place and doesn't try to annex the rest of the mall. Baker-Porter spreads across the mall like some invasive fungus. It is a colony of bacteria in the petri dish of this beautiful campus. \r\n\r\nWhy does every classroom contain the letter A in its name? Classes are hidden in weird tunnels and corridors and everyone is ok with this. This is not acceptable. Wean has beautifully named corridors and clearly distinguishable floors. Baker-Porter blends into one long deep hell floor. Baker-Porter is a Deitrich building cosplaying as a STEM student. Why is my Concepts lecture in Baker-Porter? This is because the administration feels bad for Baker-Porter and gives into its demands.",

    "title": "Scobell House Risks Facing Demolition for Multiple Violations of Pennsylvanian Law",
    "body": "Scobell House is currently the only all­-women dormitory at CMU, but this will soon cease to be the case. In the fall of 2023, this student residential building officially opened after being renovated and was converted from an all-­male dormitory to an all­-women dormitory. However, only two years after its official re­opening, Scobell House will be closed or risk being repossessed by the Pennsylvanian government to be subsequently demolished.\r\n\r\nAccording to CMU Housing Services, an anonymous student, who is in no way associated with the author of this article, alerted the Pennsylvania government that Scobell House was in violation of at least one state law. As it turns out, and obviously I didn’t know this, it’s illegal for more than 16 women to live in the same house in Pennsylvania. Since Scobell House is an all­-women dormitory that houses approximately 80 people, it is a given that there are always at least 17 women living in this house at any given time, and this flagrant violation of Pennsylvania state law will now mean that Scobell House and its residents face deserved punishment.\r\n\r\nOne has to wonder why the females at CMU have gathered in this one building, even though such an act was clearly illegal. Perhaps these witches have communed to plan the downfall of all that is good in the world. For far too long, we’ve allowed women to do as they please at this institution—let us not forget that the Carnegie Technical Schools began as an all-­male institution for the able­-bodied and able-­minded, both qualities not present in women. The very idea that women could pursue a college degree is surely absurd, as we all well know that women have one purpose in life only, a purpose stated in the immortal words that are inscribed in stone at Margaret Morrison Hall, “To make and inspire the home…” Certainly, a woman's role in society isn't to be educated and become financially independent. To prevent calamity, CMU should strongly consider sending all of the women back to the other side of the fence—to Margaret Morrison—where they belong. I suspect the residents of Scobell House are plotting something right now, just as they did three months, two weeks, and five days ago when one of their kind rejected my very sincere and classy invitation to a date at the Stack’d Underground dessert bar. Surely, they’re scheming right now about how next to utterly humiliate me.\r\n\r\nThe most likely course of action is for CMU to simply close down Scobell House and relocate its current residents to comply with the 16­-women-­per-­building limit. However, CMU’s administration should strongly consider expelling these students instead, preferably immediately, especially the one who rejected me. Relocating the current Scobellians would only delay the imminent threat they pose to this university. If allowed to fester, the annihilation of our campus will surely be ensured. I am making a very reasonable recommendation here, and I hope the university responds to this request.",

    "body": "On November 7th, README secured an interview with one of CMU's most famed figures: Dr. Illiano Cervesato, the professor for Principles of Imperative Computing. Reproduced below are some of the most intriguing, incriminating, and downright intransient questions and answers we got from this unprecedented collaboration.\r\n\r\nYour class is infamous for its strictness on academic integrity, do you think– [Iliano: Infamous?] –infamous, yeah [both chuckle] that's the word they used. Do you think that students are more likely to cheat in 122, or just more likely to get caught?\r\n\r\nMaybe both? They are more likely to cheat because it's typically freshman and some sophomores, and they don't know better basically. I think you get a lot fewer people who get caught cheating in upper division classes but just, that's the way it is. And, we do due diligence to try to catch people and I'm not sure how much due diligence other classes do.\r\n\r\n[reads next question, laughs]\r\n\r\nIt's going to be a funny one now I guess.\r\n\r\nSome people have called you the Lebron James of imperative computing. How do you feel about that?\r\n\r\nThat's a new one, okay. Is it a good thing or a bad thing?\r\n\r\nDefinitely a good thing\r\n\r\nA good thing, well okay, I guess I should feel good about it, yes?\r\n\r\nDo you have any projects that you work on in your free time, purely for fun?\r\n\r\nMaking 122 even harder and meaner and yeah, that.\r\n\r\nHow do you afford paying $2000 every semester for a single banana to be grown, harvested, and shipped all the way here to Pittsburgh?\r\n\r\nOh, that's really hard, that's killing me, and we need to find a better thing. So, we've been studying this amortized analysis thing for like years, still trying to figure it out. We tell that to students, 500 people every semester are trying to help us. They are not really succeeding, but we'll crack that nut eventually. But not now.\r\n\r\nIf a zombie apocalypse were to occur at CMU, what building would you go to?\r\n\r\nWell I would go home.\r\n\r\nWhat if you were trapped on campus? There's walls around campus to contain it.\r\n\r\nThere is one place on campus that can withstand anything. Anything. That's Wean Hall.\r\n\r\nThat's the answer I get from everyone, yeah.\r\n\r\nYes. You probably know that there is a plaque at the entrance of Wean Hall that says that it got some big award from the Concrete Manufacturers of America or some association like that.\r\n\r\nThis one just says, do you have any weaknesses?\r\n\r\nOf course not. [Both chuckle] [Iliano is serious]\r\n\r\nWould you ever throw water balloons at your students?\r\n\r\nThat's messy. I've thrown other things–at TAs more than students. I've thrown pens, I've thrown erasers probably, water balloons never come up. But I'll think about it.\r\n\r\nIf you had to hit–\r\n\r\n–no, no no no no, I did. I did. I did. [Interviewer: You did?] So, I remember that a few years ago we had a water balloon fight with a bunch of faculty and a bunch of students, and we destroyed each other. We were completely soaked by the end, and I had a great time.\r\n\r\nIf you had to hit as many students as possible with a limited number of water balloons, what is the most efficient algorithm to hit N students with 1 water balloon?\r\n\r\n[Author was given an AIV for trying to print this answer]\r\n\r\nDespite the existence of office hours, EdStem, and many other resources, several students still pass 15-122. How do you plan on rectifying this?\r\n\r\nI don't know what to tell you, maybe that's my weakness.\r\n\r\nWhat would you say is the hardest part of teaching 122? Have you learned anything from it?\r\nOh yeah, I've been learning other things all the time. What is the hardest part? Hmm. Maybe the hardest part is that you think you understand your students, then every semester, they behave differently in ways that are different from every previous semester. And you need to readjust things all the time.\r\n\r\nThat's interesting. Do you have any examples of that?\r\n\r\nExamples? Uh, it's typically things that are not clear to them. So um, let me see if I can come up with an example from the top of my head this time. There have been several things like that in this semester but nothing's coming up. But, things that they find confusing. Somehow, every semester there is a new thing that never bothered anyone in the past and suddenly you get a group of 10, 20, 30 that tells you \"I have no idea what that means and I'm making all these mistakes, and please explain this to me it's so confusing.\"\r\n\r\nThat's interesting, yeah. According to our sources, you collaborate with US intelligence agencies to catch students who cheat. Can you explain how this fruitful relationship between the CS department and the FBI began?\r\n\r\nYou mean CIA, right?\r\n\r\nBoth.\r\n\r\nThis is…this is completely false information, there is no substance to these allegations. Even if somebody has observed anything that was manufactured by the other agencies, or something.\r\n\r\nOkay okay, I'll make sure to write an entire article dispelling the rumors.\r\n\r\nYeah yeah, please dispel these completely unfounded, misleading, partially incorrect rumors.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that they've been putting toothpicks in sandwiches for as long as I can remember, but when I put a razor blade in a candy bar everyone goes crazy?\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nMust have something to do with like, physiology of the mouth of average people, I'm not sure. I am not sure. Someone should do a PhD thesis on that.\r\n\r\nI think that's all the questions I had. Do you have anything you'd like to say to the CMU population?\r\n\r\nUmm, carry on.\r\n\r\n{{ilianoCIA.png}}\r\n\r\n<i>Alleged picture of Iliano at Langley taken in 2019.

    "title": "README Insurance Scam Comes to Light",
    "body": "Last night readMe’s very own chief editor Eshaan Joshi was extradited by the Trudeau administration under several counts of insurance fraud. It was found that for the past three years he has been claiming several life insurance policies from readMe staff along with abusing Canada's generous healthcare policy.\r\n\r\nThe police investigation is still ongoing as to whether he claimed the insurance, but from what is known it seems there are several clauses in readMe’s employment contract written in white font. One of these makes Eshaan the claimant of the signer’s life insurance. It seems that this then led him to murder a bunch of the members to claim the money.\r\n\r\nHis known murders were meant to seem like natural causes in order to not raise suspicion. So far we only know the details of a couple murders. _ _ _ was drugged with Fentanyl and had an overdose faked. _ _ _ was killed in an arranged drunk driving incident. _ _ _ slipped on an intentionally placed banana peel in front of a table saw. _ _ _ had their bathwater swapped with fluoroantimonic acid. _ _ _ was shot 14 times in the chest. _ _ _ had their major swapped to computer science. All of these natural-seeming deaths were overlooked by the CMU PD when they happened.\r\n\r\nThis is creating legal troubles for him now as all of the grieving families have banded together to, in legal terms, “sue the everloving shit out of him”. He also faces criminal charges for his life insurance fraud. \r\n\r\nHe also took full advantage of Canada’s healthcare policies by embedding rusty nails into the keyboards of the readMe writers. He allegedly had an extreme free-healthcare fetish, so he would masturbate to the free hospital bills of the writers.\r\n\r\nEshaan has declined to be interviewed.\r\n\r\nCurrently for all of his crimes Eshaan is facing four counts of capital punishment, with a hearing scheduled in two months. However, the courts are uncertain about this sentence due to worries that he may attempt to claim his own life insurance posthumously.",

    "body": "So you’ve found yourself in, near, or aiding and abetting a carbon fiber tube going 35 miles per hour down a hill. Do not fear, this happens all the time. There are many reasons why you may find yourself in this situation: \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n1) You are short <br>\r\n2) You went up to the wrong table during club fair, but you didn’t realize and already took a lollipop, so you can’t do anything now except politely scan the QR code <br>\r\n3) You got so lost in Doherty that you ended up in the Stever basement <br>\r\n4) You are a mechanical engineering major <br>\r\n5) You were wandering around Schenley park at 4:30am <br>\r\n6) You are friends with mechanical engineering majors <br>\r\n7) Three ghosts visited you on Christmas Eve and you grossly misinterpreted their message <br>\r\n8) You have made eye contact with a mechanical engineering major at some point <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alongside complaining about 15122 and forgetting about the football team, accidentally joining a buggy team is a proud and century old Tartan tradition. Back in 1920, some spirited fraternity brothers made the first buggies, building and racing soapbox derby-like vehicles. These buggies were designed to look like fish, trolleys, bathtubs, and other whimsical and lively gizmos. Unfortunately, CMU students hold as much disdain for low-stakes whimsy as they do for windows, sleep, and preventing scurvy. However, thanks to the devoted efforts of generations of half-gifted, half idiotic, and fully intoxicated students, whimsy has been fully optimized out of buggy, allowing the sport to continue for decades. \r\n\r\nDo CMU students not know how to have fun? Maybe. Or do CMU students just really like putting people under 5’2” into a torpedo with a big stick and three wheels and pushing them down hills? Or maybe both? It’s both. The answer is both. Two things can be true and two things are true because it’s both. \r\n\r\nBuggy has a role for everyone with all consuming caffeine addictions who based their high school self-worth on academic competitions. Heard the story of Sisyphus and went ‘that sounds fun’? Become a pusher. Trust the safety designs of people you know can’t do basic arithmetic? Become a driver. Like carbon fiber splinters and sweeping leaves off the road before the sun rises? Become a mechanic. Under 5’2”? Maybe just avoid the area near the fence next week. \r\n\r\nNow, buggy isn’t only about composites or carrying hay bales at 4:00 am. Buggy is about stressing out EHS. It’s about angering the City of Pittsburgh Street Maintenance Bureau. It’s about having a personal grudge against Pittsburgh weather as a concept. It’s about finding the right shawarma machine to heat your wheels. It’s about the very cool and insane people you will find that right shawarma machine with. Above all else, buggy is about the look of horror on the faces of non-Tartans when you pause and smugly say, “There's actually a person in there”.",

From buggy racing, to releasing starving Scottish Terriers after hiding students covered in peanut butter, to painting the fence, the Harvard of Appalachia has a wealth of interesting activities it gets to call its own. Adding to this proud list, a new sport has captured the hearts of CMU students and onlookers alike. Inverse Bungee Jumping, as the sport has been dubbed, involves strapping participants to a bungee cord anchored to the ground, and raising them upwards with a crane. Once the crane has brought the participant to the highest possible elevation, and the chord is fully in tension, the crane releases its load and the athlete slams into the ground at mach 7. One varsity inverse bungee jumper representing the fraternity Kappa Gamma Beta, Cindy Gao, was reported to have hit the asphalt in the College of Fine Arts parking lot so fast that they instantly sublimated. While KGB is not the only Greek organization to participate in this annual event, they have caused the greatest number of human-shaped imprints in the CFA pavement. Who knows, someone might manage to blast through Earth to China one day.",

And I swear, it isn’t because it’s written by Jewish people. I have nothing against the Jewish people. In fact, a lot of my friends are Jewish! Well, not that having Jewish friends precludes me from being antisemitic, but that — I mean, I’m not friends with them because they’re Jewish, they just happen to be both Jewish and my friends. So I’m definitely cool with the Jews.\r\n\r\n<i>Jesus </i>[Editor’s Note: Really? Interesting choice of messiah], <i>Benner, what are you doing? Get a grip. Just… just move on already. </i>\r\n\r\nAll I’m saying is that some of my Jewish friends have a rather dark sense of humor. Particularly the ones who write for ReadMe. And there’s nothing wrong with that! Everyone enjoys a macabre joke every once in a while. But sometimes, from an outside perspective, it can look a little… questionable. Especially when they make these jokes in public. I mean, I understand that humor can be a way of coping with generational trauma. I’m not trying to say that isn’t okay! I totally understand the appeal for self deprecating humor. But we are in a very sensitive political time right now and, well, sometimes these kinds of jokes can come off rather poorly.\r\n\r\nThere might not even be any problems! I trust my friends to make good decisions while writing, and they’re all very funny people. It’s probably fine.\r\n\r\nLook. I don’t think I’m getting my point across very well. I just… wow. I don’t know how else to say this, but… The Jewish people in ReadMe have said the most antisemitic things I have ever encountered. I’ve heard absolutely vile statements come from the mouths of my Jewish friends. If I repeated them, it would instantly make me unhireable. I’m talking about talking points ripped straight from medieval Europe. It can be really, really bad.\r\n\r\nAgain, this isn’t because they’re Jewish! I love the Jewish people! And I’m definitely not antisemitic! I’m just trying to explain that no, I swear I’m not a Nazi, my friends are just assholes who also happen to be Jewish. \r\n\r\n<i>Oh man… This is not how I wanted this to go. What am I even saying? You need to save this right now, Benner, or you can kiss any hope for an internship goodbye. </i>\r\n\r\nDo I need to convert to Judaism? Because I’ll do it. I am fully prepared to devote my life to reading the Torah and cooking for Shabbat dinner. Just please, someone let me know what I can do to make this stop. I’m a good person I swear. Christ <i>[Editor’s Note: Hmm.]</i>, why am I even trying? It’s hopeless! Why does it have to be me? I’m not an antisemite! You have to believe me! It’s not my fault! It’s their fault! No, I mean, I don’t want to blame the — goddammit, it’s not the Jews’ fault either! I’m so sorry!\r\n\r\n<i>Oh god, why did I have to use my real name for this goddamn newspaper?</i>",

    "body": "Freshman Ari Steinberg has spent every summer at Camp Ramah in New England since he was 9 years old, so he thought living in a traditional triple on the third floor of Mudge would be easy as alef, bet, gimel. And he was ready to survive a few weeks of 80-degree weather with no air conditioning. But as it turned out, being in the dorm was more like being in the bunk with the other friend group. “My roommates don’t want to play ultimate frisbee or Magic: The Gathering with me,” he complained. “But on the bright side, at least they aren’t flashing me every now and then when their ‘towels slip.’” Steinberg also found some trouble adjusting to the Mudge third-floor communal bathrooms, noting that while no one ever threatened to pee in a cup and splash it on him for taking more than 30 seconds in the shower (which he says is “not an exaggeration”), he’s disappointed by the total lack of conversations in the bathroom. “Sometimes I’ll hear somebody talking in there and get excited, but then it always turns out they’re just on the phone with someone,” he said. “At camp I knew everybody in my year and almost everyone in the year above and below me, why don’t I even know most of the people in my dorm here?”\r\n\r\nSteinberg was also surprised with how he used his time after getting to CMU. “O-week felt like camp: a bunch of planned activities that I skipped because they were boring as fuck. Meals were kinda like camp too with them having us all eat shitty buffet food in a big room all together, but I kept expecting them to start handing out benschers before people could leave and doing Birkat. [Author’s note: the fact that I have to write an author’s note to explain what this is should make it pretty clear why this doesn’t happen. Anyway, go look at the glossary on page (whatever).] But once classes started, everything I knew came crashing to the ground. At camp, they only let us have an hour of free time a day, plus a few more on Saturdays. Here, though, everything is free time, but not free time that I can just use to chill with my friends. I have to do homework! My chugim never gave me homework….Oh, chugim are like classes, but at camp, and they don’t give you homework.”\r\n\r\nSteinberg did point out one thing that he felt really did carry over from his time at Ramah. “At camp, we have this concept called the sixth-week slump,”  he explained, “where you’ve been at camp for six weeks out of the eight and you want to be having fun and doing all the camp things but really you’re exhausted and miss your parents and are so ready to go home and it’s so close, but you have to tough it out because as soon as you get home you’re just gonna hate your family again. Yeah, each half-semester is kinda like that. Oh, also the building right at the front of campus is the main office. Camp is like that too. Though Warner hall isn’t connected to a building with no AC where I can do arts and crafts. That one’s across campus a bit.”\r\n\r\nreadme tried finding other Jewish summer camp alumni at CMU to comment, but they seemed to all be at Washington University in St. Louis, which sources say is just like camp.",

    "body": "If you’re a masochist looking for a reason to bash your head against a wall for five hours straight, then Kirby’s Adventure for the Nintendo Entertainment System is the game for you. This eldritch abomination of a video game is the sole reason my NES is currently shoved in a dumpster.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the story is just pitiful. There are only three characters (and one twist villain) that have any importance, everyone else is just irrelevant. The game’s “twist” villain is not foreshadowed at all and is just a pitiful excuse to attempt to redeem the game’s main antagonist, King Dedede, who I’ll remind you in the previous title literally stole all of Dreamland’s food. I wasn’t expecting a Red Dead Redemption 2-level story, but something of substance would’ve been appreciated. Where are the ancient civilizations, alternate dimensions, tales of loss and grief, and eldritch gods? I’d assume at the very least Kirby would have an interesting backstory, but no, he just “blew in on a Spring breeze.”\r\n\r\nAll of this isn’t even mentioning the abhorrent gameplay. The controls are slippery and unintuitive. Why are floating and jumping separate buttons? Why can’t you just press jump and start floating midjump with the same button? It would make platforming so much smoother. And don't get me started on the inconsistent mess that's inhaling. Kirby can normally only inhale enemies his size — fine — but then why can he inhale minibosses twice his size after they’ve been defeated? Also, some enemies his size can’t be inhaled for whatever reason. Shotzos, Scarfys, Gordos, and Meta Knight are all Kirby’s size yet for some reason he can’t inhale them. Where’s the consistency?\r\n\r\nAll that's not even mentioning the copy abilities, a promising idea that is poorly executed. They are woefully unbalanced; sword and hammer are objectively the best abilities. They both allow for full movement range, can execute midair attacks, can do fast and consistent damage to all enemies, and even work underwater. The rest either make you freeze in place when you use them (spark and fire), force you to move potentially into pits (wheel and fireball), don't work on bosses (throw and backdrop), or are just plain bad (sleep).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the game itself is unfairly balanced. It looks innocent on the box, but right from the get-go, the game immediately taunts your lack of artistic skill with its opening (I spent five fucking hours trying to follow that damn tutorial). And once gameplay starts, it only gets worse. Bosses are either a cakewalk with a good copy ability or a super boring waiting game of “wait for them to do an inhalable attack and hope you aren’t on the wrong side of the screen or it’ll disappear.” Levels are plagued by unintuitive enemy placement and control issues, leading to multiple unfair deaths. The side minigames are also straight-up unfair. Beating King Dedede in Quick Draw is nigh impossible unless you can see the future and Crane Fever is rigged (if the big Kirby plush spawns the back you’re just screwed). \r\n\r\nThe game also runs like garbage. Parts of the sprites disappear constantly, and god forbid you or an enemy use spark or freeze; the game’s framerate will plummet lower than the Wii U’s sales. I found myself getting game-overs constantly due to framerate issues combined with slippery controls. And of course, when you get a game over you have to restart the entire world all over again.\r\n\r\nArt-style-wise, a pixel art game from a big publisher like Nintendo is just sad. Also, why is Kirby pink? I’ve always headcanonned him as yellow—it just felt right. He’s also a bit too cutesy for my liking; maybe it’s because I’m American, but I think he’d be more marketable if he was more aggressive-looking.\r\n\r\nThe games director, Masakado Sakurai, is clearly incapable of creating a good game.

Unfortunately for our joyful childhood spirits, the very 1984 United States of America government passed a law in 2012 that “ Whoever knowingly aims the beam of a laser pointer at an aircraft shall be  imprisoned for 5 years, or both“. \r\n\r\nAs we all sat for years, marinating in our pent up desires to blind a pilot, unhealthy habits emerged - heroin, crack cocaine, etc. Psychologists from Carnegie Mellon University (Actually a single psychologist from CMU, who avid Readme readers will know) managed to convince the city of Pittsburgh to allow a “cheat day”, where any legal repercussions against such noble acts are entirely voided.\r\n\r\nThis is not just a quick summary of the news, but very important information we want to spread to our dear readers. On October 3rd, 2024, feel free to shine your laser pointers at overhead planes, medical helicopters, and so on and so forth. As an added bonus, Readme will use our funding to award the student who successfully downs the most planes a 76.2 mm anti-aircraft gun Model 1935 (34-K).",

    "title": "Readme's Moderately Late Guide to Choosing your Freshman Dorm",
    "body": "As a freshman, freshwoman, or fresh non-binary person, part of your experience will be to live in one of CMU’s 13 premium housing options or Donner House. Without further ado, here’s Readme’s guide to everything you wish you’d known when you’d ranked your housing choices. We’d have published this article before room choices were due but then you’d have taken our advice when choosing your room.\r\n\r\n<b>Boss and McGill Houses</b> - Your classic dorms. Both buildings are exactly the same. You’ll be in a quantum state of living in both buildings at once, which is great for having two bodies to get done your insurmountable amounts of homework. They also have semi-suite bathrooms instead of communal bathrooms, which is nice until you realize you’re not only sharing the bathroom with your four suitemates. You’re also sharing your bathroom with their rotating casts of significant others.\r\n\r\n<b>Clyde House</b> - Doesn’t exist. It’s on CMU’s website because Readme hacked it.\r\n\r\n<b>Donner House</b> - Exists, unfortunately. Donner tends to be the home of athletes for CMU’s top-tier athletic programs, but really it’d be better suited for CS students because of how bad the showers are. Why not give the dorm with the worst showers to the students who don’t shower? I’ll never understand. Other than CS students, I’d only recommend living in Donner if you’re an insect. The dorm’s insect community truly is superb.\r\n\r\n<b>E-Tower</b> - When Carnegie Mellon decided to make E-Tower, they set out to make a dorm as mediocre as your roommate’s shower singing. . Then, they realized the location was too nice so to even things out they took out nearly all common spaces and just built a skybridge to Morewood Gardens so you can use their amenities instead of having your own. Hey, at least it’s not Donner. And the secret sex dungeon in the basement is pretty cool too.\r\n\r\n<b>Hamerschlag House</b> - Has been closed for the past two years for renovations. Experts expect the building to be slightly less miserable now, but the communal bathrooms and dreadfully small windows remain. This is a great building if you hate your good ole’ daily dose of natural light. Experts anticipate it taking three days before someone does something stupid enough to make CMU regret giving students access to a lounge space on the roof.\r\n\r\n<b>Henderson, Scobell, and Welch Houses</b> - All equally boring. They’re all up a hill so you’ll get your daily steps in whether you like it or not, though less likely if you’re a woman because Scobell is all women and the closest dorm to street level. The inevitable conclusion here is that CMU just really doesn’t want women to be fit. This helps even the dating field for all you heterosexuals. I would lie and make up something funny so that Henderson, Scobell, and Welch had something interesting about them, but Readme takes journalistic integrity very seriously.\r\n\r\n<b>Maggie Mo Houses</b> - Used to be frat houses. They’re not anymore, but pro tip: nobody is stopping you from throwing ragers there anyway. Except your RAs, but that’s besides the point. Imagine what has been done to your furniture and kitchen counters at your own peril. Otherwise, these are basically just your basic townhouse. Imagine a suburban family of four living here, except stuff way more people in and make everyone first-year college students. So, not the average suburban townhome experience you probably came to college for.\r\n\r\n<b>Morewood Gardens</b> - Doesn’t even have a garden. At least 17 students got so lost in the corridors last year they were never found. The secret to not getting lost is to develop echolocation and make clicking sounds as you navigate, which is especially important during the rolling blackouts. Morewood also burns down three times a year for first-year rituals scheduled between two and five in the morning, so stay on the lookout for that. If you hear the fire alarm, do not panic—the building is only incinerating into ash. CMU is usually pretty quick to reconstruct the building, but they refuse to update anything.\r\n\r\n<b>Mudge House</b> - No you’re not living in a mansion, dearest B and C tower residents. Only A tower is a mansion; B and C towers are sad, boring, and for the plebs. If you live in B or C towers your local A-tower aristocrat will let you hang around the first floor of the mansion, but don’t be fooled: you’ll never be rich and live in a mansion. You’ll also never be happy but that’s not a dorm-specific thing.\r\n\r\n<b>Residence on Fifth</b> - Because you need an in-unit kitchen. Actually no, you don’t. You’re a first-year student; you’ll probably burn the building down and if you’re lucky, maybe you’ll also get the high school next door. You don’t need a two-bedroom apartment either. When you get sexiled, trust that your roommate won’t want you in the room next door either. And, you don’t need to be that far away from campus. Like seriously, it’s like a full couple of minutes away from campus. Do you want to have to walk a few extra minutes a day? I don’t, and you’re not allowed to have a different opinion from me. Do the math.\r\n\r\n<b>Stever House</b> - Remember that dorm you saw during your tour? Also, remember how that random guy killed your tour guide in that dorm before wheeling the dead body away in a stroller? Stever is that dorm, and no, I wasn’t the killer. Stop asking, seriously. Stever is loud, proud, and should be neither. Like it’s not even that nice. Communal bathrooms and rooms so small you’ll be missing your Hong Kong apartment, anyone? Readme additionally warns you that the fifth floor of Stever is gay.",

    "title": "Maggie Mo Daycare Lemonade Stands Busted",
    "body": "Carnegie Mellon University, humble home to a rambunctious fourteen thousand students from across the world, manages a tight ship on its campus. CMU has risen to international acclaim thanks to its remarkable near-abstinence from off-campus travel, partying, and many other plagues of state schools. This abstinence is in no small part due to our proud CMUPD. This past Monday, police successfully raided the Tech Street lemonade stands, run by the young children of the local daycare – another successful hit against the threats to our proud Scotties.\r\n\r\nThe lemonade stands, as described by the tangentially-involved Officer Jones, were taken down swiftly and strictly in the name of the law.\r\n\r\n“Well first off, none of these children are licensed,” he elucidated in a recent interview, “and Pittsburgh takes a clear no-tolerance stance on street vendors without proper paperwork.” \r\n\r\nStandard response protocol, as Jones explained, for a simple unlicensed vending charge would have been to simply put the perpetrator up in jail for a few days with a small standardized bail. We inquired about the duration [“...starts at a week or so”], about the bail amount [“Oh, yeah, we’ve mathed it out, as close to the family’s monthly grocery budget as we can guess”], and if these seemingly drastic responses applied to the age range of perpetrators in question.\r\n\r\n“Of course, we do these [raids] all the time with minors. Local teens primarily, you know how those are. Straight to the ol’ slammer.\r\n\r\n“It sends a message, y’know, keeps ‘em from trying something new… hell, don’t give that face. For these little ones, we ensure their top safety. We spent last month’s budget on the Little Tykes remote controlled cruiser and some plastic cuffs, like they’re playing House. We’re keeping them safe and comfy, even if we gotta teach them a serious lesson.”\r\n\r\nBut these stands exhibited clear signs of a danger bigger than their diminutive stature, setting Jones’ senses tingling to something sour. For one, several caretakers were allegedly present at the scene, actively aiding the young children in their shop logistics — and resisting police activity. \r\n\r\n“Any adult in their right mind would make sure, if these kids weren’t running a licensed operation, to put their foot right down. The way I see it, those folks weren’t just ‘nannies’. They were in on the operation. The way they kicked and screamed at us for tossing these kids in the car, I knew they had something big to lose.”\r\n\r\n The officers also made note of recent hubbub around lemon-related institutions on campus – notably a recent, unnervingly similar fundraising event by the Lemon publication. From this, Jones deduced a hypothesis: they were all interlinked. Somehow, a sect of organized crime had coagulated in the dark corners of CMU, and was collecting funds through lemonade means. \r\n\r\n“It makes me sick,” Jones lamented in the interview. “This is a noble institution. This isn’t what Carnegie would’ve wanted. I, and all my officers in the CMUPD, are just doing our part to make things right. No matter how young these children are, they are feeding into a dark system, and we’ve got to make sure they can’t perpetuate it further.”\r\n\r\nThough the laughter of small children no longer fills the air on bright Margaret Morrison St. mornings and one can no longer enjoy a $1 plastic cup of sugary lemonade in the heat, we know in our heart of hearts that because of this, CMU – the noble institution it is – will endure for another day.",

    "body": "I write to you now as a call to take action. These are trying times, and all members of Carnegie Mellon’s community today are suffering. As such, I implore you all to take a stand today to root out an evil from our beloved campus.\r\n\r\nToday our God-given, American, English-speaking heritage is being eroded. The youths of today bastardize our language. Influenced by foreign, alien forces, they feed poison into our language in the form of arcane and accursed words, diluting the power we hold so dear. They poke holes in our sacred rules, inviting ridicule. And they share their horrid utterances with one another, bamboozling dictionaries into accepting their made-up words. \r\n\r\nIt has come to my attention that playground-goers have developed a new abomination. While all true English words have only one meaning, this newfangled creation reeks of multifunctionality. Its versatility cannot be overstated. It’s used to express both joy and discomfort, as an expression of disapproval, and in reference to immoral “web videos” and “image macros.” Naturally, I will not refer to this word in writing and shall only call it “the fuck word.”\r\n\r\nI have tolerated the fuck word for far too long. While I would never associate with any individuals who use verbiage of such profane nature (for which I coin the term “profanity”), I am nevertheless forced to breathe the same air as those on campus who do. So-called “cool” professors, campus police, and even our student newspaper constantly spew the fuck word into our pristine spaces. In fact, anybody who uses the fuck word deserves the death penalty. If my child said the fuck word after hearing it said by a college student (evil incarnate), I would shoot them right on the spot. Thankfully, change is on the horizon. \r\n\r\nOn December 14th, 2024, ne’er-do-wells in no way affiliated with ReadME painted a horrible message on the fence. I actually agree with the message, but because they used the fuck word, I am morally obligated to hate them. Student Senate rushed to the rescue. To preserve the eyes of passersby, they immediately censored the fuck word. However, after coming into contact with the fuck word, they had to amputate their hands to reduce the risk of contamination. We must honor their service. \r\n\r\nThe Carnegie Mellon Student Government Graffiti and Poster Policy does not make any restrictions on content except prohibiting messages that are libelous in nature or violate the Carnegie Mellon Code. So, It’s obvious that Senate is relying on the Disorderly Conduct Policy, which prohibits “the use of abusive or obscene language or gestures to/by a member of the campus community.” While the fence painter was not found, I’m sure that Senate would have pursued harsher punishments. I am hopeful that this policy will expand to apply to the spoken word and on-line “direct messages” between students.\r\n\r\nI ask of you, Student Senate, continue to do your excellent work. The fight is far from over. I would like to suggest some other policies to assist you in your crusade for justice: the Academic Integrity Policy, the Computing Policy, and the Prenatal Radiation Exposure Policy, applied liberally, should allow you to crack down on the fuck word.\r\n\r\nPresident Farnam Jahanian: Immediately terminate any faculty or staff that make use of the fuck word. The reputation of the university is on the line. In order to keep the funds of Carnegie Mellon’s benefactors from falling into the wrong hands, you must implement a zero tolerance policy. Any person employed by Carnegie Mellon University who says the fuck word must be immediately stripped of their position and pay and also killed.\r\n\r\nAnd to you, readers of rEaDMe: as the members of Carnegie Mellon with the most refined tastes, I implore you to make your voices heard. Distance yourself from any “friends” you might have who say the fuck word. Drop any classes where you so much as hear someone saying the fuck word outside. And most importantly, use your newfound free time to tell Farnam Jahanian to never allow the fuck word on Carnegie Mellon campus ever again by calling him repeatedly at this phone number: █████████.\r\n\r\n*Editor's Note: Isn't this just doxxing?*\r\n\r\nWith your support, we can take charge of the issues that we care the most about. But we must work together.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nFulke Fuchs",

They may need to be put down. \r\n\r\nFinally, readme is getting bored with the lack of controversial opinions, and is proud to announce a \"America's most racist relatives\" competition.

    "body": "As one of the most reputable sources of news on campus, readme staff took it upon themselves (with only a few threats of violence) to research one of our oldest and most favored traditions — bitching about Carnegie Mellon. While several old letters were uncovered complaining about the homework, the weather, and the lack of sex on campus, several staffers found a small box in the basement of Hunt that included documents dating back to the first ever buggy race. \r\n\r\nWhile Carnegie Mellon would like you to believe that Buggy was founded by a group of well meaning fraternity men hoping for a little carnival fun, the documents discovered show that the first ever incident of a buggy race occurred in early 1919, and included just one freshman. Jimmy “Snot­nose” Peters, class of 1923, had rushed every single fraternity on campus, much to the annoyance of the brothers. After discovering he planned on continuing the frats until he finally received a bid, the brothers of Delta Delta Delta came up with a plan. They told him that Carnegie Mellon fraternities had a tradition of putting freshmen inside caskets with wheels attached and rolling them down the Frick Park hill. Should he go through with this tradition, Snot­nose was promised that he could go to one of Delta Delta Delta’s notorious ragers for fifteen minutes. The young lad was overjoyed, and found himself inside a rather small pine box being rolled up down the hill in the wee hours of April 16th, 1919. \r\n\r\nAfter a particularly drunk Delta Delta Delta brother lost control of the casket, it was sent careening into Maggie Mo. Snot­nose did not survive, and in his memory, Carnegie Mellon students continue to harass anyone under the height of 5’2” in the hopes of shoving them inside a metal tube.

At first, I had hope that we were all being lied to, that the photos were doctored. Alas, upon returning to campus, I saw it with my own eyes. The SAE Lions were gone. \r\n\r\nI knew this day would come, but I was not prepared. In our lives, we rely on our constant truths. I relied on the SAE Lions to welcome me to campus. They got me up in the morning. How am I supposed to keep up with my classes, when such a great tragedy has befallen our campus? How am I supposed to go about Greek Sing without the glue that held Greek Life together? \r\n\r\nI don’t know how we move forward. As I walk down Morewood, my soul feels empty. The street feels empty. The campus has lost the little character it had. I have 30 days until I find myself  walking across the stage and receiving my diploma. I always thought I would have the SAE lions to walk me through campus one last time. We never have enough time with the ones we love. We never know the right time to say our last goodbye. We never know what we have until it’s gone. I never even took a photo with them. \r\n\r\n“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out —because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.” I will not let them come for the lions. I will speak out. To whoever committed this hate crime, please do right by the world and undo your atrocious act. \r\n\r\nWhy am I even trying? Kids these days do not even remember painting the lions. They haven’t and will never know the joy of waking up to find out what they would look like that day. The heart may be in the work, but the lions will always be in my heart, even if the rest of the campus is ready to leave them behind.",

Modern warfare is not just conducted on the battlefield: it is carried out in the home and in the minds of every enemy citizen. Ever since humanity’s first battle was waged, wars have been fought over the support of the public.\r\n\r\nIt is because of this new understanding of total war that README is proud to announce its new partnership with American defense contractor Lockheed Martin. This deal follows the announcement of Lockheed Martin’s new Propaganda Unit, where US-hired mercenaries will fight tirelessly to ensure that even the families they bomb will agree with American foreign policy. As a renowned distributor of state-sponsored propaganda, README has gladly agreed to lend its writers to the noble cause of finding oil in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nRanked number one in number of accidents and number five in legal settlements over contractor misconduct, Lockheed Martin’s reputation is unmatched. README is dedicated to upholding Lockheed Martin’s good standing among war machines across the world. As such, new writers looking to join README will now be required to lobby Congress for increases in military spending by at least $999,999,999.99. If an applicant's lobbying is successful, they will be welcomed into the staff of README, having proven themselves a true God-fearing patriot.\r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon has enjoyed the funding of Lockheed Martin for nearly 40 years. Selling one’s soul for a high salary is a time-honored tradition, and one that README is honored to continue. Plus, it’s not like there’s many other writing jobs out there, so I’ll take what I can get.",

    "body": "The unfortunate financial situation you’re in is not uncommon among new students. You may have managed to get into CMU — yippee! — but you had to give up your life savings and right arm in order to pay tuition. While Valentine’s Day will never be the same with the loss of your right arm, there’s a pretty reliable solution to the loss of your life savings. That solution, also applicable to most of life’s problems, is drugs.\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact that CMU boasts the highest number of student drug addicts on this side of the Mississippi. However, due to the fact that the average CMU student tends to look like a complete narc, nearly all major drug dealers refuse to sell to us. In addition, most of the older students here have already spent too much time in this hellhole to risk losing it all. That is where you, my dear freshman, can come in to fill the market. So long as you know what to sell and who to sell it to, you’ll be rich in no time.\r\n\r\nDrug preferences at CMU are a very fickle thing, and you don’t want your product to be something no one wants to buy. For example, depressants are a no-go; no one would ever bother to buy those when they can just take concepts. On the opposite end, people here go rabid for stimulants. It's well-documented that in the first year or so of attending, most CMU students grow completely immune to caffeine. Thus, cocaine has earned itself the name Carnegie Sugar™ on campus as the most popular caffeine replacement. I’d recommend being (or recruiting) a chem major as your supplier.\r\n\r\nAs for who to sell it to, there are a few groups you can target, either for one-time sales or hopefully gain permanent customers. Fence-painters are a prime target; it’s very common for at least one of their picnic tables to be covered with lines of coke. Just sell them a batch as they start painting, and hopefully you can negotiate to continue to provide whilst they guard the fence. They win because they can stay awake, and you win because, as long as there isn’t a political message being painted, CMUPD is unlikely to see. In a similar vein are Buggy organizations. When it comes to those sad people, as long as you’re willing to wake up early every weekend from mid-September to Carnival, you’ll make thousands.\r\n\r\nI would be remiss to not warn you of the greatest danger this line of business has: other freshmen. The murder of competition is a common occurrence on campus; if the fence is painted red, a free and abundant paint alternative was likely used. Needless to say, don’t try to sell to a fellow freshman unless you want to be used to paint the fence. You must also be willing to get your own hands dirty, too. Try looking around to see if anyone else is reading this article; if someone is, then they are a rival. Speak to them, befriend them, and when the moment is right, end them. If you're lucky, you might have cause to make your double a single.\r\n\r\nNow the only problem you have left is laundering your money, but just get a Tepper student to do it for you. It’s not like they have anything better to do.",

The great American pastime of manifesting destiny is, while not unheard of, frowned upon by most of Europe. Pioneering American students tried many popular manifest destiny strategies, but none of them seemed to work. \r\n\r\nManifest destiny has come a long way in recent years. Gone are the days of dysentery, cholera, cannibalism, and people saying “hey stop taking my homeland!”. But the essence of the doctrine remains: this land is our land, and anyone who isn’t American, doesn’t speak English, eats with their hands, or worships idols is a barbarian, and needs to go back to where they came from. CMU continues this proud tradition, hoping to expand its influence to yet another continent, after CMU Africa went so well. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Europeans have not taken this well at all. CMU students were threatened by angry natives when they tried even an eensy weensy bit of colonization. Readme took statements from multiple students of various backgrounds. One British student complained, “They’re taking our ideas- the Americans learned colonization from us!”. A Spanish student remarked, “Si continúan, recuperaré Florida personalmente.” A Belgian student declined to comment.",

Wake up and see that all the governments in the world, including the US, Russia, and China, have all been collaborating just to keep us from the facts. In this program, you’ll be able to do thought-provoking experiments, such as sending satellites up into the atmosphere, which includes an added seminar of How To Manipulate Your Data So It Proves Your Point.

Sorry, you should totally just read me, don’t worry about it. I’m full of advice, rankings, updates around campus, probably a sports section— usually. This issue there’s a, oh, a Valentine’s Day thing going on… Well, that sucks. I don’t have a date. I mean, same as last year, right? I’m a tabloid. I’m made to be read. Nowhere else I’d rather be.\r\n\r\nSo, while you get started reading, are you just taking a break from work, or are you headed to class soon?\r\n\r\n*(tell the ReadMe what you’re up to)*\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nI see. That’s great for you, or maybe awful. Anyway, I just got printed this last Tuesday. It was really warm, I got to meet all the other READMEs. I was worried that I might have an error. I probably do, but that’s okay, right? I think little mitsakes like that make you who you are.\r\n\r\nHey, this is probably a weird thing to ask, but do you ever feel like the wind might just blow you away? I just always feel like— you probably don't get that, forget I said anything? Sorry, I don’t think I’ve told anybody that before. But, to put it simply, I feel like there's never been anything holding onto me. Well, until…\r\n\r\nY’know, you’re really easy to talk to. We should talk more, yeah? Okay, I’ll see you soon.",

    "body": "Thirsty? Good. You read the headline. You know what you’re here for.\r\n\r\nNumber 10: The Doherty-100 automatic water bottle filler. Mechanically speaking, positioning your receptacle under a dedicated drink-dispensing orifice qualifies as milking. Viscerally, it does not quite scratch the milking itch – but it is a worthy introduction to the milkosphere.\r\n\r\nNumber 9: The True Burger Pepsi dispenser. The dispenser creates a cozy atmosphere with a satisfying amount of grime, improving both venue and flavor. To echo one Reyzl Limenesser, Pepsi is an excellent enhancement to standard milk: legendary Pilk, pre-squeezed milk mixed with hand-milked Pepsi, is a wonderful draft indeed.\r\n\r\nNumber 8: https://tinyurl.com/MysteryMilkObject\r\n\r\nNumber 7: A runny nose. Catch yourself a cold and give it a big, sloppy, nasal exhale, and you’ll get to enjoy fresh fluids of your own. It may not yield snot in bulk, but, for a quick DIY cheese-squeezing experience, this is all you need.\r\n\r\nNumber 6: The TechSpark 3D printers. They demand an involved setup, but a thick stream of polylactic acid pushing through a hot, high-precision nozzle provides for an impeccable lactation sensation. Drink it straight from the tap for a true body-heat feel, or save an elaborate model to snack on later. Remember: Plastic doesn’t curdle!\r\n\r\nNumber 5: Eggs. Eggnog is a true wonder of the holiday season, so why not bring it into snowy January? Squelch a fresh egg into glass – or why not, straight into your chasm of a mouth. Skill issues permitting, a delicious, viscous adventure awaits.\r\n\r\nNumber 4: SDC’s buggy, Lust. It’s really into it. The ambiguity of the relevant fluid is truly secondary to the almost-human emotional resonance you’ll feel with this vehicle. If you have an open-minded friend on the team, and you’re looking for an immersive, reciprocated milking affair, this is the curb to hit. \r\n\r\nNumber 3: A canvas tent in the rain. Those luscious bulges of collected water in between the rafters are just waiting for you to come by and squeeze. This is the premier one-to-one tactile lactic experience, and it’s a happy coincidence of meteorology that you get fresh water alongside it.\r\n\r\nNumber 2: The Doherty Creature. ██████████ ████ ███████.  ████ █████ ███ ███ away. Take ███████ ██ ███ █████████ run. ██ ███████████████ ██ █████ ██. ██████, ████ ██ ██ alive. ████████. Godspeed.\r\n\r\nNumber 1: \r\n\r\nYou. \r\n\r\nSee you soon.",

The elevator proceeded up to floor 4, where I was headed. \r\n\r\nThis girl stepped out, looked all around, realized this was not floor 3, and then took the stairs down to there.

    "body": "It is a melancholy object to those who walk though this great campus, when they see the streets and roads crowded with loud-mouthed hooligans. Studious learners must keep their windows boarded, and their doors shut to keep the noise from irresponsible teenagers who, as they grow up, either turn to business majors, or leave their dear native campus to party at Pitt. They take up spots in CIT and SCS, while forcing innocent students to live in cramped chambers, originally meant for two, in groups of three.\r\n\r\nI think it is agreed by all parties, that this prodigious number of students, many unworthy of this prestigious institution, currently enrolled at Carnegie Mellon is a grave mistake. In the present state of this great university, I have found a fair, cheap solution to the rambunctious noise and over-enrollment.\r\n\r\nI propose each well adjusted, quiet, respectful student shall receive a bow and quiverful of arrows. Students shall be permitted to hunt tumultuous students from from the dead hours to the break of dawn. By my calculations it should only take around a dozen students with arrows lodged in their sternums for a quiet and order to be restored upon this great campus.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, our glorious Carnegie Mellon is known to have an over-enrollment problem. I have calculated that upon the successful hunting and termination of these so-called “students” forced triple lodgings shall be a thing of the past. Even better, long waitlists for classes will be abolished. Per my calculations thirty percent if not more of each course is filled with bumping, bumbling, buffoons. It is egregious that this great university entertains this tomfoolery. The hunting of these dastardly devils for sport would solve this grand dilemma. Finally Carnegie Mellon would only be composed of quiet, gracious students.\r\n\r\nIt is no secret that this great university is not known for athletic students. This is a great source of shame, however, the institutional encouragement and promotion of hunting loud troublemakers for sport will alleviate this source of shame. Per my calculations the current muscle density of a Carnegie Mellon student is equal to that of a weak bunny-rabbit. After an institution-wide promotion of hunting these thunderous thugs for sport the average Carnegie Mellon student should gain the strength of the average 12 year old.\r\n\r\nI profess in the sincerity of my heart that I have not the least personal interest in endeavouring to promote this necessary work, having no other motive than the public good of my college, by promoting a culture of peace and quiet, promoting exercise, and dealing with over enrollment.",

Experts suspect that Patient X lied on their consumption screening prior to move-in, but they have not yet found any evidence of such duplicity. Kept awake with chest pain at night, Patient X tosses and turns in their luxurious quad beneath a red velvet blanket. Lavender handkerchiefs have been supplied for Patient X to delicately hack up blood into. Mudge Mansion RAs implore Dining Services to make a thin gruel for Patient X to subsist on, for they have no stomach for even emergency ramen and their frail body will surely waste away without sustenance. \r\n\r\nUHS has been tasked with providing a treatment plan. They have prescribed Patient X with bed rest, giving them a brief but blissful reprieve from attending lectures. Windows in Mudge Mansion must remain open at all times to give Patient X respite from foul air. Maintenance is in the process of converting the balcony of Mudge Mansion into a solarium for Patient X to experience the benefits of heliotherapy and to soak in the fresh city air. If Patient X’s condition improves, they will begin daily calisthenics at the koi pond. Discussions are underway to convert booths into chalets to further isolate Patient X from the rest of Mudge Mansion. \r\n\r\nIf the ailment spreads, Farnam himself will consider converting the top floor of Mudge Mansion into a sanatorium. Some protest that Patient X should be sent to Saratoga Springs for more comprehensive and specialized treatment while others have expressed concerns that Patient X would be enticed to transfer to Skidmore by their superior dining hall and freshly baked cookies. Other residents of Mudge Mansion are advised to pull all-nighters in the library to avoid contact with Patient X.",

    "body": "Hello everyone! Mike Rophon, ReadMe’s resident sports announcer here to bring you the rundown on the spectacular events of the past few days. Since the sports scene on campus is going through a rough patch, I’ll be bringing you the play-by-play of yesterday’s homicide.\r\n\r\nAuntie Readme was found dead, skewered to the Walking to the Sky monument and the autopsy found that this was the result of several misplays over the course of the preceding days. Now Auntie Readme's first and biggest mistake was getting stabbed 47 times. This happened in the early stages of the first quarter and forced them to play catchup with their internal bleeding for the rest of the game. \r\nOh, and did I mention how well the internal bleeding played last night? Not only did they have a strong start, expertly capitalizing on Auntie Readme’s mistake, but they utilized their expert teamwork by managing to cause not 1, not 2, but 3 whole organ failures!!! A special shout-out to the Deep Cervical Vein who was easily the MVP of the homicide. They were single-handedly responsible for the most blood loss of anyone else in the game.\r\n\r\nThe last half of the fourth quarter was where bad became worse for Auntie Readme’s team as their inability to keep pace with internal bleeding left their defense completely unprepared for the Walking to the Sky monument. It was certainly a risky move on the coach’s part to end Knife’s strong stab streak (47 according to the autopsy) by subbing it for Walking to the Sky, but it seems to have paid off. We asked Knife for a comment but since authorities have been unable to find it, we can safely assume that it is disappointed that it wasn’t able to finish off the game. Even so, Walking to the Sky swiftly ended the game with a big assist from blunt-force trauma.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, Auntie Readme stood no chance against the all-out strength of their opponent. Poor preparation, lack of skill, and a failure to adapt really kneecapped their chances at winning. No wonder they say that the wounds were self-inflicted! Regardless, team homicide has a bright future going into the murder championship.\r\n\r\nThis has been Mike Rophon, resident ReadMe sports announcer, signing off.",

    "body": "It's everywhere: overnight, CMU seems to have been struck by a trend taking campus by storm. Once a utilitarian beverage, water has become the hottest cold drink on campus, leaving every floor slick and a line behind every water fountain. \r\n\r\nWe attempted to interview one student partaking in the trend on the Mall. \"I've started guzzling my clear sloppy style,\" he stated. \"I'm getting it everywhere. Dripping down my chin, my chest, splashing up on my forehead, ohfuck.\" The student proceeded to slam back a full, dewy Nalgene of cold water, splattering it across the dry sidewalk. \r\n\r\nWe walked into Doherty Hall, where we found a student clinging desperately to a water fountain, drinking water at an alarming rate, chest pressed against the button, hair drenched and caught in the fountain's drain holes. Their mouth was pressed directly to the brass nozzle of the water fountain, lips pursed. They were almost writhing. As we stepped over them, their eyes darted toward us wildly and they grunted in surprise and pleasure. \r\n\r\nWe continued down the stairs, where we found a small cluster of students handing around a plastic bottle of Aquafina. They were loudly arguing. The topic seemed to be one participant's excessively large swig of water from the communal bottle. When her turn came around, another student lunged for the bottle instead, and the circle collapsed into a brawl. A colleague of mine pulled one battered individual off of the pile, but they immediately leapt back into the fray, desperately throwing punches and grasping for the bottle.\r\n\r\nIn Porter Hall, we found lines coming out of every restroom, and areas were demarcated with tape and biohazard signs. Apparently, as one UHS staffer told us, students were intentionally contracting cholera. \"The faster I can rid my body of the water, the more I can drink,\" one sweat-soaked student told us. Her face was contorted in agony, but still, she took long drafts from a crumpled plastic bottle. She suddenly sprinted to the nearest restroom, leaving us holding out our microphone to a blank wall. \r\n\r\nIt's a mystery to the broader populace of Pittsburgh what caused this frenzy. Trucks of bottled water are being rerouted to Oakland, at prices far exceeding retail value. The plumbing on campus has become a bottleneck for the flow of tap water, forcing labs to switch to large drums of deionized water in lieu of plumbed H2O. Many hope the trend will die down soon, but it shows no sign of stopping, nor any clues as to its origin. \r\n\r\n<b>Read More:</b> Monongahela cocaine incinerator fined $2 million in landmark contamination case",

Due to the harsh, cold, and miserable winter weather, Readme has taken it upon itself to dig new, safer steam tunnels so students can maneuver between buildings without stepping out into the elements. Readme’s dedicated new interns, led by the ever faithful Meat, toiled day and night for many moons to have these tunnels finished for their dear readers, so please use them, we’re begging you! (We know it’s not perfect, but they didn’t let us have any breaks and we’ve been surviving on Celsius and saltine crackers, just let us have this).\r\n\r\nThe new steam tunnels boast state-of-the-art heating and cooling, 12% less asbestos, and are perfectly legal to travel through, as long as you get a signed document from President Farnam Jahanian for every trip. They connect every building to every other building at CMU, except Donner House. So now, if you enter Doherty 1117, go through a trapdoor, climb a ladder, solve a material balance, and order a hard apple cider at La Prima (Gates) you may descend into the vast new steam tunnels, where you’ll find a whole world of magnificence, entertainment, and rats awaiting you in the darkness. \r\n\r\nThe new steam tunnels let students emerge at convenient spots around campus, such as directly in front of President Jahanian’s office, in the line at Hunan Express, atop the Hamerschlag Radio Tower, and inside the Tartan Express food truck. Readme hopes this will minimize traffic congestion near such areas and promote a safer, calmer environment aboveground. \r\n\r\nWith winter weather fast approaching, it’s important to keep warm and cozy while traversing campus between classes. To promote a festive and cheerful atmosphere, Readme will be hosting weekly events in the new steam tunnels, celebrating the new year, Carnegie Mellon, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Our first activity will be finding the three interns we lost during construction. Find us in the new steam tunnels at 5 pm on Saturdays!",

Complaints of the hefty weight of the toolkits have come from freshmen already burdened from carrying their 6-pound 17-inch gaming laptop to and from class. Recent complaints have also included that the tool kit is too small to store the ever-expanding egos of ECE students. Starting spring 2025 each freshman in 18-100 will receive a rolling toolbox. This should keep the strain off the shoulders, and the drawers offer a plethora of storage options for even more labs. The course will now be able to feature a 10th lab, where students are tasked with creating a 1:1 replica MacBook Air.",

Do you remember Barbara? Such a shame! And you know what her mother said? Rachel is moving to Philly for her residency. A doctor! Can you believe that? It would work out so well and you won’t even let me set you guys up. Fine, fine, I won’t. You know I do so much for you and this is all I get in return. I said I won’t. Oy, I don’t get an ounce of appreciation from this family. \r\n\r\n<b>2) Too focused on (unsuccessful) career </b>\r\n\r\nWow, you want to be a writer! That's what the world needs more of. Why can’t you be more like your brother David. He and Rebekah are both gastroenterologists, just like Rachel is going to be. Why won’t you let me set you up with Rachel?\r\n\r\n<b>3) You stopped going to synagogue after your bar mitzvah</b>\r\nYou don’t even go to shul during the high holidays. Remember when you wanted to be a rabbi as a kid? Remember Morah Rivka? With the hair? She would be so disappointed in you. It wouldn’t kill you to show up once in a while you know. Just say hi to the Goldbergs. They asked about you the other day and all I could say was that you’re an unmarried schlemiel.\r\n\r\n<b>4) Your stupid haircut </b>\r\nYour hair is too long. It’s unkempt. I don’t get your generation. Can you even see? I just worry about you bubbeleh. How will you raise my grandkids if you can’t even go to the barbershop? \r\n\r\n<b>5) Are you gay? I’d be fine if you’re gay but you have to tell me</b>\r\n\r\nYou know I lived in New York in the 80s. I’m hip. But there's no good reason that a nice Jewish boy like yourself isn’t married. Are you gay? You can tell me if you're gay. I heard Susie’s son was gay. Why won’t you let me set you up with Susie’s son? He’s a gastroenterologist.",

Pittsburgh. \r\n\r\nIt was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway, but for 28-year-old Manhattan barista and renter John Novak, even a glimpse into the festive booths at Carnival turned into an existential crisis on the state of real estate.\r\n\r\n“It was insane. I went in thinking it was gonna be the usual. No natural lighting, no furniture, and one of those heaters that sounds like the Bombing of Dresden,” Novak recalled, still visibly shaken. “But then…I saw them…”\r\n\r\nNovak, who pays $2,700 a month for a 100-square-foot apartment on the Lower East Side, was stunned by the sheer audacity of the booths, which boasted colorful decorations, fun themes, and even hardwood floors. \r\n\r\n“These kids don’t understand how good they have it. Some of these booths have stairs. Stairs! The last time I lived in an apartment with stairs was when that couple from Williamsburg went upstate and left their door unlocked. They left their son there, but turns out we were on the same dosage for Adderall. I miss that guy. He was the best roommate I ever had.” \r\n\r\nWhen questioned by reporters on whether anything from the booths reminded him of New York, John had this to say:\r\n\r\n“When I was standing in line inside one of the booths, I really felt at home. The wall of plastered college kids in front of me reminded me of my roommates: Mark, Jim, Motif, Felipe, Kurt, Vin'nyla, a stray dog, Eric Adams, and that prostitute who keeps stealing my stuff…Oh wait, that’s Eric, too.”\r\n\r\nSources confirm that Novak was spotted attempting to negotiate a year-long lease for the SDC Booth with freshman Jeremy Chen, a Business Administration student. When asked to comment, Chen remarked, “He was begging me to rent the place to him… it was kind of sad. He had a pain in his eyes that I had never seen before. It made me realize something. When I grow up, I want to be a landlord.”\r\n\r\nNovak was last seen attempting to fit his couch in Undergraduate Senate’s “Lynchian” themed doghouse.",

This decision was made in the wake of Carnegie cup’s carnage. While details are murky, efforts to relocate the fence to Wean’s roof, and an incident regarding Welch students and a penguin from the Pittsburgh zoo.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the chaos started Tuesday during an Etower rally. A sudden thunderstorm forced events to be held inside for several hours. Orientation leaders led students in chants ranging from “Who’s got the power?” to detailed descriptions of crushing other dorms. \r\n\r\nLocal expert in cults, Dr. Col Aid, claims that this was the inciting incident.\r\n\r\n“Once Etower’s staff successfully converted their dorm into a cult, the rest of the dorms followed. The results are quite remarkable. Students exhibited similar behaviors by the end of orientation week to individuals who have been cults for half their lives.” \r\n\r\nThis isn’t Dr. Col Aid’s first time on campus. “Every year there’s a few limbs lost. We put measures into place after that to ensure no further cults were created. At the time we were confident that they’d work.” \r\n\r\nStudents can be expected to spend the rest of the week at workshops organized by Dr. Col Aid and CAPS. Topics include “how to avoid cults, mlm’s, and phishing schemes” and “for the love of God please don’t set Hamershlag on fire again”",

This is in opposition to proprietary software, in which the source code is private and under strict copyright protections. Until recently, even the state of Pennsylvania has taken such a restrictive view on licensing: driver's licenses, despite being easy to copy and modify, are placed under unnecessary and limiting restrictions.\r\n\r\nCMU, as an institution for the promotion of knowledge, stands in opposition to anything which limits our collective enlightenment. In the world of computer science, this comes in the form of vigorous support for the FOSS movement, even in the face of great adversaries like Bill \"Spiral\" Gates. In order to further these ideals, CMU is proud to announce its latest project, the world's first free and open source driver's license.\r\n\r\nMuch like the GNU Public License (commonly known as GPL, or as I've recently taken to calling it, G+L), the open driver's license would use \"strict copyleft\". This means that, while anyone is free to derive their own copy of the license, this derivative license must also be free and open source.\r\nWhile making a driver's license available to every citizen, and noncitizen, and nonresident, and nonhuman entity, of Pennsylvania comes with some challenges, it also brings opportunity. \"I like how I can customize so many of the details,\" said one 19 year old who we interviewed purchasing several cases of beer. At the scene of a tragic automobile crash just outside, we interviewed a 12-year old computer whiz, who was shaken and badly bruised, but very enthusiastic about the program.\r\n\r\nGiven the hugely positive reception of the open source driver's license, CMU is now looking into several spin-off projects, including MIT-licensed MIT engineering degrees.",

    "title": "Optimal Conditions for Black Mold Farming",
    "body": "<b>Abstract </b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nBlack mold (Stachybotrys chartarum) is a fungus known to grow in apartment buildings rented out to college students by slum lords. This phenomenon is usually absent from buildings with proper ventilation systems, begging the question: how could black mold be grown in a dorm room? Many of the conditions required for the promotion of mold growth are already present in a dorm room. The main deficiency, however, is adequate moisture. Hence, most of this study focused on increasing the moisture content of a standard dorm room. Multiple methods were tested for increasing the moisture content of a dorm room such as clogging air vents with chewing gum, stealing water vapor from showers, and utilizing air humidifiers. Our study succeeded in finding optimal mold growth conditions, and as a matter of fact, all the surfaces were covered in mold.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Methods </b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nAll conditions necessary for black mold growth are naturally present in dorm rooms at Carnegie Mellon University with the exception of sufficient moisture. Hence, this study focused specifically on increasing the moisture content of a dorm room. A common method in which standard building codes deal with moisture content in rooms is by mandating proper ventilation. Such requirements go against the needs of mold farmers and must consequently be disabled. In this study, every dorm room was broken into via air vent to confirm the presence of an air vent – with 100% confidence, each room had one. In order to create optimal moisture conditions for mold growth, chewing gum was used to clog air vents, resulting in a 237% increase in air moisture. \r\n\r\nThe moisture content observed in the experimental room was sufficient for black mold growth, but not optimal. More moisture was necessary from external sources. Many dorm rooms are directly connected to bathrooms, which are a major source of moisture, especially during a shower. In such dorm rooms, the door separating the dorm room and bathroom can just be left open when showering to increase moisture even further. If such an arrangement is not present, putting a shit ton of air humidifiers in your room might work. The maximum moisture content we managed to achieve in this study was 507% the moisture content of the original. This was sufficient moisture for ideal black mold growth. In fact, black mold ended up covering all open surfaces in the dorm room, and by our metrics, this study was beyond successful. The scientific and medical outcomes for this will be phenomenal. Absolutely tremendous.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<b>Conclusion </b>\r\n<br><br>\r\nDorm-based black mold cultivation is a promising field with many potential benefits to tomfoolery and accidentally killing your roommate with significant fungal allergies. This study also serves as a great jumping-off point for future research regarding other types of fungal cultivation in a dorm room. We believe that this study will empower students to become hobbyist mycologists who might go on to solve the ever pressing issue plaguing Carnegie Mellon’s Campus: It is well known that CMU has a drug problem – where are all the drugs?",

    "title": "Optimize Your Garden With These Simple Tricks",
    "body": "Dearest reader, consider this inquiry: You are the sole proprietor of a home garden (a real one, not in Animal Crossing or wherever AOC makes her press releases nowadays). You own the land free and clear. You go out for mocktails every week with the two other gardeners in your market, and you talk about your businesses and why you love your family (ugh). You have a good reputation. Every week, a nondescript hooded figure stops by and buys 24 watermelons, and their purchases only seem suspicious like half the time. You pay the neighborhood kids twice minimum wage to do - I don’t know - whatever happens in a garden. (I’m an expert, not a day laborer - I have no idea what actually goes on.) You have a quality work-life balance. Yadda, yadda, yadda, sunshine and rainbows, insert more boring stuff here.\r\n\r\nSounds like you’re doing great, right? Wrong. Consider the alternate hypothesis that you are stupid and spineless and have no idea how to derive a competitive advantage, optimize for cost, increase your return on investment, discount your cash flows, penetrate your market, or let alone commit white-collar crimes. I know, I know - the fun ones are the non-white-collar ones, but bear with me: white-collar crimes can be fun too.\r\n\r\nYou said you own the land free and clear? That’s stupid. You’re tying up so much money in the land that you could be spending to, I don’t know, buy a yacht, donate to a presidential inauguration, or contribute to your divorce legal expenses. The real strat (yes, ‘strat’ is the formal business term - it’s what I hear at the business parties all the time) is to constantly borrow mortgages against the land you own, and borrow again immediately once you’ve returned the money. It’s just like when you borrow Hillbilly Elegy by JD Vance from the library over and over again.\r\n\r\nYou go out for mocktails and boring conversations with your competitors every week? That’s also stupid. One of your competitors is stealing your business secrets and plans to put you out of business, and I saw the other kissing your mom the other day. Although you shouldn’t have wasted your life on things like hanging out with friends, but I can offer you a small consolation: Now that they think you’re stupid (you are, but that’s beside the point), you can abuse their stupidity by framing them for tax evasion and/or stealing the overpriced purple chairs from Tepper - in that latter case I’d appreciate if you could send the disappeared chairs my way. And then voilà, your competitors are in jail and you can jack up your prices to $69 a watermelon. Although the nondescript hooded figure surely won’t like those prices (they’ve never had much of a sense for business), where else are they supposed to get 24 watermelons a week?\r\n\r\nYou claimed you had a good reputation? That one’s smart, actually. But you’re doing it stupidly, because you’re stupid. Here’s a revelation: you don’t have to gain a good reputation from honesty. In fact, that’d just be a waste of your money. Are you telling me in order for your customers to think you’re philanthropic you actually have to donate money to the children’s cancer center? Of course you don’t! You just have you say you did it, and blackmail anyone who dares to question you with stupid things their kids have done. See, I told you white collar crimes were fun!\r\n\r\nAnd worse yet, you pay the neighborhood kids twice minimum wage? I’d tell you to pay them only minimum wage and then deduct from their pay for a white-collar charge, but you don’t even have to do that. Just feed them a watermelon per week of work - it’ll pale in comparison to how many watermelons that nondescript hooded figure buys.\r\n\r\nI hope I have sufficiently convinced you of your poor business sense. You may be thinking that you’ll be exchanging general life happiness for your business’s cold-blooded growth. If so, you’re already on the right track.",

    "body": "At the beginning of this week, a\r\nThe Tartan spokesperson revealed to\r\nReadme in an exclusive interview that\r\nCMU Administration and The Tartan\r\nwere planning on reviving a\r\ncopyright dispute that is over a\r\ncentury old against Radford\r\nUniversity. As it turns out, CMU is\r\nnot the only institution with a\r\npublication named The Tartan, with\r\nRU's student publication also sharing\r\nthis exact name. \"Given our school's\r\nnamesake, we would be remiss not to\r\npursue legal action in the name of the\r\ngreat American spirit of enterprise\r\nand capitalism\", explains the\r\nspokesperson.\r\n\r\nDetails for legal action against RU\r\nwere discovered when a group of\r\nstudents was rummaging through the\r\nUC's backrooms searching for old\r\nThe Tartan articles for archival\r\npurposes, particularly one article\r\nwhose content shall not be named.\r\nUpon discovering documents\r\ndetailing the feud, they were\r\nforwarded to CMU Administration.\r\nCuriously, the cease and desist\r\nletter was supposed to be sent in\r\n1921, the same year RU's newspaper\r\nbegan, but a whole 57 years before\r\nRU's publication, originally known as\r\nThe Grapurchat, had changed its\r\nname to The Tartan. Perhaps Andrew\r\nCarnegie's business acumen allowed\r\nhim to see the future and stop the\r\ndark timeline of a competing\r\nUniversity stealing our beloved\r\npublication's name, or perhaps, being\r\nthe ruthless capitalist that he was, he\r\ndecided that he owns the very concept\r\nof a student­run college publication.\r\nUnsure of the grounds for the\r\noriginal feud, as well as the original\r\nplans for escalating legal action, CMU\r\nadministration and CMU's The\r\nTartan has decided to hire a team of\r\npriests and priestesses from various\r\nreligions in the hopes of communing\r\nwith the ghost of Andrew Carnegie\r\n(and maybe Andrew Mellon too as a\r\nlittle bonus, not that he matters).\r\n\r\nPushback against CMU's decision\r\nhas been vocal. Some have voiced how\r\npetty it is to revive a copyright feud\r\nthat is now over a century old.\r\nFurthermore, attempting to commune\r\nwith the ghost of Andrew Carnegie is\r\nnot without risk. Expert spiritologist\r\nJohn Spirit explains \"Communing\r\nwith [Andrew Carnegie's ghost]\r\ncould bring calamity to campus if he\r\ndiscovers the absolute state of\r\nAmerican work ethic. In my expert\r\nopinion, I would suggest that the\r\nUniversity set up fake steel mills and\r\nhire child actors to be the workers.”\r\n\r\nRU has only just received the cease\r\nand desist letter, and we all await\r\ntheir response with bated breath.",

    "body": "Though I’ve always considered myself an admirer of Irish culture, I am ashamed to admit I was quite ignorant of its complexities. My appreciation was limited to wearing green on St. Patrick's Day, making offhand comments about leprechauns whenever I saw a rainbow, and eating the occasional potato. \r\n\r\nI am ignorant no longer. After being kicked out of Hunt Library when it closed last Friday, I was walking back to my apartment in Oakland when I heard Kinky Boots playing from one of the pubs. It was like a reckoning. Immediately, I was overwhelmed by Irish culture. No longer did I only have a watered down version of Irish culture of leprechauns and four leaf clovers, I was granted an inside look into what Irish culture actually is. I laid in the street, unable to get up, dreaming about spending afternoons in a pub in Dublin, Guinness in hand, watching ships come to port through the fog. \r\n\r\nEventually, I was woken from my stupor when the song ended. I raced back to my apartment to play Kinky Boots in private. I threw out my microwave mashed potatoes, dyed my head red, bought a khaki suit, a flak jacket and a pair of kinky boots. \r\n\r\nNow, all I want is to own a farm in rural Ireland. Instead of waking up at 8 AM for 15-213, I want to wake up at dawn to herd my sheep to green pastures with my border collie. Instead of walking through the tunnel system from Gates to Wean, I want to take my Saracen to town through cobbled roads. \r\n\r\nI’ve become a changed man. I’ve started eating from Schatz just to try their mashed potatoes and cornbread. I sit in the back of lecture halls, headphones plugged in, listening to Kinky Boots. All I want is to be a part of the jolly Irish culture so beautifully depicted in that song.\r\n\r\nWait. What do you mean it’s about the British?",

While you all were busy, we at readme were also busy, sniffing out crime on campus. Really getting into the dirt for this one. Interested? Read this to catch up on all the terrible horrible things that have happened to our beloved CMU while you all were away.\r\n\r\n\r\n**WEB OF LIES**\r\nIn a shocking twist of events, a large crocheted web was erected over the main campus buildings. According to authorities, this web had been up for about two weeks before anyone took action. It was only removed because many Pittsburgh citizens grew worried about the reason for such a strange creation. Also, the emails and phone calls were starting to pile up. Currently, CMUPD is trying to unravel the culprits and any students in the loop behind such a heinous crime. If you have any ideas on the case, please contact readme@cmukgb.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n**GREEK HOUSE HORROR**\r\nAttention all CMU personnel! Authorities are on the search for the person(s) who stole all of the letters off of the Greek Houses. The English-looking letters were found in Schenley Park in what appeared to be an oversized game of Scrabble which was outlined in crudely done chalk. However, none of the exclusively Greek letters were found anywhere in Schenley. Authorities are under the belief that these letters are being held hostage in someone’s house or dorm. In an interview with a local fraternity brother, he suggested that it was “a tragedy” and was “calling for the safe return of [their] beloved letters”. Please help save these Greek letters and bring them back home!\r\n\r\n\r\n**FENCE GONE, CMU DISTRAUGHT**\r\nLast night, a group of students staked out the Fence. It was reported that they poured about 100 gallons of paint stripper and distilled vinegar on it to clean up the built up paint. The Fence was constructed of 95% built up paint and only 5% actual fence, which happened to be super brittle and old. Unsurprisingly, it immediately fell apart when stripped of all the paint. Now there is no Fence. Many are left in deep pain. A group of students have created an ambitious plan to glue the Fence back with paint, but we at readme are not sure how successful it will be considering parts of the Fence have disintegrated and turned to ash. CMU staff and the student government have no idea what to do about the new state of the Fence and have elected to allow this to happen until a real solution is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FRESHMAN DECORATIONS GO AWRY**\r\nCarnegie Mellon is in shambles. Who allowed the freshman dormitories to be painted their respective colors? The windows are one thing, the whole building? Donner, of course, is not affected in the slightest since the building was already the color of the Caribbean Sea. Many of the freshman RAs claim sabotage from the blue dorm. However, Donner claims this was all an attempt to smear their name. Who knows? Barely any of the upperclassmen care, and the staff believe this is some sort of dormitory spirit thing. The maintenance care though, as they have to clean it up now. Rumors flying around indicate that they plan to increase the cost of maintenance requests by a factor of 200 because of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay safe, Tartans!",

    "body": "As CMU alumni return to their alma mater for the carnival season, one question is at the top of their minds as they see their former classmates: “Did they peak in university?”\r\n\r\nTo help out our fellow Tartans, we have created this guide on how to identify people who peaked in university.\r\n\r\n<b>1. Are they a grad student?</b>\r\n\r\nGrad students are just people who peaked so hard in college they’re spending a few hundred grand to avoid leaving. Instead of building new lives, starting families, growing savings, they are just doing the one thing they know best: procrastinating on actually starting anything, like having a career.\r\n\r\n<b>2. Are they still posting on LinkedIn?</b>\r\n\r\nWho actually uses LinkedIn now that they have a professional life? Only people desperately trying to convince everyone (including themselves) that they're thriving. They should focus more on their current lives rather than stalking people's careers and seeing if other people are successful, even though they knew them to be complete bums in undergrad who couldn't even finish Core@CMU correctly.\r\n\r\n(Please send me a connection at https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-rozansky/ – I need the validation to sleep at night)\r\n\r\n<b>3. Are they your ex?<b>\r\n\r\n100% peaked. Don't even worry about it. \r\n\r\n<b>4. Are they trying to go to a frat party with people who were in middle school while they were studying business here? </b>\r\n\r\nC’mon man, at least hit on people within the same decade as you.\r\n\r\n<b>5. Do you dislike them?</b>\r\n\r\nIf you dislike them, then of course they peaked in university! There is no possible way this person is actually succeeding in life or is even happy at all. Basic science proves that people you personally dislike cannot possibly be thriving.\r\n\r\nThis can even be applied to current students! If you don't like them, they definitely peaked in high school and are currently in the midst of a four-year downward spiral. That's just karma working as intended.",

    "title": "Pentagon Swears In New War Crime Scapegoat After Previous One Died",
    "body": "{{tanktank2.png}}\r\nThe US Department of Defense has recently concluded its emergency internal election to find a worthy successor to the previous war crime scapegoat who unexpectedly died this year. The election was hastily called because there were no contingency plans in case the last scapegoat died, as no one at the Pentagon expected the US public to still remember the massacre that took place 56 years ago. Although finding a replacement for this role was of utmost importance, one can not help but wonder if it was worth it to dedicate so much time and a part of the US military’s shoestring $916 billion budget to the running of the elections, or perhaps the US public just needs to suck it up and forget that several hundred civilians, almost all women, children, and the elderly, were killed. I mean, it happened over half a century ago, big fucking deal. Regardless, the Pentagon decided to appease these overly sensitive and unpatriotic Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon has had a long history of using scapegoats to have its leaders not take responsibility for war crimes committed overseas. Since the last one was so effective, it’s natural that the Pentagon is pursuing this same strategy: although many members of the military, including senior officers, were found to be connected to the massacre in the original investigations, only one was convicted, and no one seemed to bat an eye.\r\n\r\nThere were many strong candidates, and it certainly wasn’t easy for members of the Pentagon to vote for who they felt was the best choice. One long-time frontrunner is a 5-year-old orphan from Kentucky. “Kentucky already has the highest rate of maltreated children, so we thought mistreating another, by imprisoning them, would go over well with the public”, said Hen-Rhea Kissingher, Director of War Crime Cover Ups at the US Department of Defense, who requested to be anonymous, “but we decided that the public wouldn’t readily accept the idea that a 5-year-old is responsible for the massacre of at least 347 civilians that took place 56 years ago. Maybe if the death toll were lower—around 200 at most—we’d be able to convince people.” Ultimately, the candidate who will soon be sworn in later this year is Jesús Krist. Jesús is the son of immigrant parents, born to a Slovenian father and Mexican mother, and owns a woodworking shop dedicated to teaching Jewish youths at his mosque in El Paso, Texas. “This scapegoat-elect is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: Jesús is Jewish, he’s a carpenter, and with a name like that? He’s the perfect person to die for our sins.”\r\n\r\nOne of Kissingher’s assistants later followed up with us in private to assure us that Jesús would only proverbially die for our sins and assured us they would make sure he would only have to serve at most 20 years imprisonment. It should be noted that, just as what happened with the previous scapegoat, Jesús’s sentence is likely to be reduced to 3 years of house arrest.",

    "body": "The Office of Community Engagement and Leadership Development recently sponsored a kayaking trip on the Allegheny River for incoming freshmen. While it was overall successful (97% retention rate), some students had a bit of a scuffle with some geese while out on the water. Chaperones noted that three or four boats had fallen somewhat behind, and it was unclear what was causing the delay. One junior reported, “I could see the boats rocking back and forth, feathers were flying in the air, and a few minutes later we heard a splash. On the bus back, some of the people from those boats were saying they got bitten by the geese, and now they felt sick. As soon as we got back to campus, Health Services rushed them off the bus and we haven’t seen them since. Though, I swear I saw their necks lengthening over the half hour ride back. Probably nothing, though.” \r\n\r\nCMU’s Health Services released this statement: “On Saturday, we had to quarantine 8 students due to waterborne gastrointestinal illness. We expect them to make a quick recovery. In the meantime, they will be provided with all necessary materials to continue their studies, which are of utmost importance. If you hear squawking sounds coming from the quarantine area, this is just the sound of students in excruciating pain. Similarly, the feathers scattered around the building are from a spontaneous pillow fight because the students are bored, not because of any wild animals running around the campus. That would be ridiculous.” \r\n\r\nReadme investigators have been unable to reach any quarantined students, receiving only honking and a sound similar to wing flapping when calls were answered. When a Readme journalist attempted to find the quarantine room, they were pointed in the direction of what appeared to be an indoor wild fowl enclosure.",

    "body": "{{physicsemail.png}}\r\n\r\nAn announcement sent out earlier this week to Carnegie Mellon University students has created widespread controversy and discourse. The email, as seen below, disclosed an important warning for all students to avoid the Gates Hillman Centre on 11/25/24.\r\n\r\nMany on campus are worried about the potential implications of dropping a 60-tonne boulder. Some have voiced their concerns, worrying that the giant boulder could crash through the roof and roll down the Gates spiral, leading to an impromptu and unwelcome reenactment of the Boulder scene from Indiana Jones. Others have stated that the experiment is unorthodox and unneeded, referencing the University of Pittsburgh’s recent study of dropping a 30-tonne tungsten ball from the Cathedral of Learning as more than enough evidence that gravity continues to exist. \r\n\r\nOthers have hailed this experiment as groundbreaking. One student interviewed inside Wean Hall even saying “No no no, you’ve got this all wrong. I’m worried that the boulder could actually crash through Gates and into the ground, this is a terrible idea and I don’t unde” Unfortunately, our interview was cut short as the student was dragged away by two very friendly-looking representatives of the Department of Physics.\r\n\r\nDespite the mixed reception to this notice, the Department of Physics has released a statement, confirming that the experiment will still be proceeding, however, they did provide an outlet to those disgruntled few.  A “Complaints Council” has been formed and will be meeting in Gates-Hillman on 11/25/24, about 14 meters to the right of the crane above the building.",

    "title": "A modern dialectic of oppression",
    "body": "In our day and age, we have had the pleasure of learning about the mistakes and sins of our forefathers, and have been given the opportunity to redeem ourselves as a global civilization. In many ways, we have, with many free to practice their cultures — however as we advance past industry 5.0 and the 4th scientific paradigm (ever so edging toward stage 1 on the Kardashev scale), it becomes more evident that our technological advances are only a thin veneer hiding away the grotesque reality. Allow me to provide a very personal example, highlighting the dialectic of modern inclusivity.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite beverages of all time is pilk – Pepsi mixed with milk. (Note, there are many different ways to make this drink, but I prefer a 1:1 ratio of the two constituent ingredients). For those unfamiliar with what pilk tastes like – it would remind one of a sweet, creamy, brown sugar milk tea, and as it is more economically feasible to buy the necessary ingredients (due to economies of scale), this concoction is more than a worthy substitute. Whenever I pull up to a function, and I see that there is Pepsi present, many may recall me boldly inquiring, “where the milk at?”. I am immediately sneered at by all these self proclaimed “righteous” men (cretins, the lot of them)…\r\n\r\nWhat happened? What happened to all of the inclusivity talk I have heard from these same individuals? What happened to accepting minorities and other cultures? When I, a member of my own personal culture, attempt to hydrate, I am ridiculed by my peers for it? If this does not embody the legacy of cultural hegemony (something very prevalent in American history), I do not know what does. We cannot claim to be a progressive society if this is how we treat some of our most minute minorities (there is only one of me, and over 8 billion others). After much contemplation and introspection about theories in my mind, I have concluded that there is no such thing as a radical negation of this dialectic specifically, but there are two possible proceedings. We as a society can alter our interpretation of the world and the diversity of human culture in a more post-structuralist manner: viewing the act of drinking pilk through a more quasi-anthropological lens, such that we embrace cultural relativity as a maxim to live by, and entirely reject any notion of objectivity. The other solution to this problem is more trivial. We can urge (or force) our elected officials to throw a dart on a map and kindly deliver a nuclear warhead to the country it lands on. This will hopefully result in a global nuclear war of total destruction — if there are no people left, there will be no living culture, and the oppression I face will no longer be an issue (and no one will be around to care about it either). \r\n\r\nReally, I am a simple person, and I would only like to better the world in regards to cultural acceptance. As the great philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon once proclaimed, “I dream of a world where I would be executed as a reactionary”, and so on and so forth.",

    "body": "On September 3rd, 2024, the staff of the student-run newspaper “readme”, serving Tartans true and peer-reviewed news since 2024, decided to go on strike in an unprecedented display of resentment towards Eshaan Joshi, CEO of said newspaper. This strike happened after months of attempted negotiations with Mr. Joshi over payment, which he refused to pay, while Mr. Joshi went on to buy avocado toast and gold plated toilets. The staff attempted to negotiate with their boss numerous times, and to each Mr. Joshi replied: “there is nothing to negotiate.” After at least 47 attempts to negotiate, the Amalgamated Satire Syndicate (ASS) called a general strike for all student-run publications on campus. The Tartan refused to hold the picket line, and were therefore deemed bourgeois boot-licking class traitors.\r\n\r\nASS completely closed off all access to DH 1117, and did not allow anyone to cross, including Mr. Joshi. Joshi made many obscure threats at the workers, including forcing everyone to enroll in 21-127 Concepts of Mathematics. ASS did not budge, and responded to the threat accordingly — arming themselves with Nerf guns. This alone left Mr. Joshi spiraling, and he decided that the only path forward was to fire all the staff and replace them with Pitt students. However, the recent militant development of ASS necessitated violence. Hence, Mr. Joshi contacted the Pinkerton Detective Agency via telegram, and they responded “The year is not 1892 anymore”. Mr. Joshi convinced them to use rejected CMU applicants from New Jersey instead of their own men, and promised to pay them more than 5 dollars. The Pinkertons agreed.\r\n\r\nOn September 12th, the Pinkertons landed their barge on the north shore of the Monongahela river, and marched northward to CMU via Schenley Park. These rejected applicants are just happy they are being given a chance to prove their worth to the CMU community.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the UC 3rd floor, the untrained Pinkertons were petrified at what they saw — they were never told they would have to shoot people. Regardless, the Pinkertons were here to do one thing, and thus, one SCS reject, wearing hot pink, fired the first shot at the striking ASS workers. The bullet missed, and ASS managed to shoot every single mercenary who dared show up. The battle was over, and ASS had won.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the news, Mr. Joshi was terrified, and took his case to CMU president Farmam Jahanian. ASS effortlessly managed to wipe out the Pinkertons, what do you think they can do with all the military-industrial complex money the school receives? Mr. Joshi succeeded in convincing Dr. Jahanian to send in the Pennsylvania National Guard.\r\nOn a lovely September 15th, the ASS workers were sitting in lawn chairs in front of the Wean La Prima  until a loud shatter of glass was heard.\r\n\r\nFrom a helicopter, in swung a member of the Pennsylvania national guard, who aimed his rifle at the ASS workers. The same happened from the other direction, essentially cornering the workers. NERF guns are unfortunately no match for real weaponry actively used to violate the Geneva Conventions in the Eastern Mediterranean, and thus ASS surrendered, bringing their 12-day strike to an end.\r\n\r\nWhat happened afterwards was shocking. \r\n\r\nThe staff were all brought in handcuffs to the Mall, where instead of everyone being summarily shot, as we do with our writers after every issue anyways, the Pennsylvania National Guard pulled out a guillotine, like the thing French people trim their toenails with. Mr. Joshi watched with glee, knowing the ordeal was over, and to conclude this unfortunate series of events, all the ASS members were administered HRT (Head Removal Therapy).",

These plinko machines had the point values replaced with political parties. When city officials tested the devices, it was discovered that certain plinko machines were missing pegs. As of right now, there is no sign of the culprit who has scampered off with the ballots. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Voter Fraud Ring Caught Before Elections**\r\n\r\nA large-scale voter fraud ring for the Holiday Window Display competition has been busted recently by the City of Pittsburgh.  It was discovered five hundred people were voting multiple times under multiple names online and in person in the beloved competition. The city vows to crack down on voter fraud this upcoming holiday season to make sure this does not happen again. \r\n\r\n**Pittsburgh Signs Now Read Pitsburg**\r\n\r\nIn a recent discovery by city officials, 81.3% of signs, flyers and posters mentioning Pittsburgh are now spelled, Pitsburg. Some of these signs were more subtle, replacing the sign with a new one misspelling the city. Other signs simply had the city name crossed out and replaced with Pitsburg in shoddily written handwriting. It was only noticed when government buildings also became misspelled. Several Pittsburgh native confessed they had seen the changes, but didn’t care enough to bring it up. Some citizens have suggested renaming the city to Pitsburg. Officials are currently discussing the matter. Until then, the signs will remain up.",

NO! \r\n\r\nWe in the editing staff felt a strange sense of familiarity while reading over our previous issue to prepare it for publication, and upon investigation (which consisted of multiple sleepless nights fueled exclusively by Monster Energy during which we pored over every issue of every newspaper ever written), we discovered that every single one of our writers has lifted their content directly from the 16th issue of the 118th volume of the Tartan, published on March 11, 2024 (notably the day before our fourth issue was printed). We greenlit the issue anyway, which may have been a faux pas on our part, but why should we, the innocent editors, take any responsibility for anything bad that happens? Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me in every single article written in an entire issue, shame on the writers.\r\n\r\nWhat have we, the editing staff, decided to do about this? While we do intend to take our time making the right decision during this very difficult time for our organization, we have summarily shot Benner Rogers, who we *thought* was our only reliable journalist, for this betrayal. We apologize for our lack of oversight and for this great violation of the integrity of our organization.\r\n\r\n*Disclaimer: This article was heavily inspired by the plagiarism notice in a 1998 issue of The Lancet.*",

I know you might think I'm obsessed with you in a deeply creepy romantic manner, but I'm not. You work for Nakatomi Defense Corporation, on the 17th floor of their New York campus, in office 1712b. You got the job straight out of college, where you got a BS in Chemistry with a 3.98 GPA, and had a committed boyfriend who broke up with you on December 2nd, 2011. Your studies focused mainly on colloids, with applications to nuclear science. In your job, you manage logistics for a similar project, which my handlers are very interested in.\r\n\r\nI'm a trained industrial spy, though I can't say from where. That's the true reason I've been following you home from work every day. Though you are rather attractive, I’m only covertly watching your every move to collect the secret details of Project Silent Fletcher, which you work under, not because I feel like I deserve for you to love me.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to clear this up because of the awkward encounter we had yesterday when I bumped into you on the street. It may have made you uncomfortable when my briefcase burst open and thousands of pictures taken of you scattered across the pavement. But it's all just so my employers can better understand the material characteristics of the secondary stage of the warheads your office designs.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for understanding.",

    "body": "{{gucci.png}}\r\n\r\nThe president of Carnegie Mellon University, Farnam Jahanian, recently issued an email apologizing for a typo in a recent tuition update sent to students. The email incorrectly notified students of a 3.72% price increase in tuition. In reality, the increase was 37.2%. Jahanian’s email writer, who also ghostwrites for README, stated that the slight raise in costs was necessary for improvements throughout campus. \r\n\r\nOne of the improvements the money will go towards is the hygiene of dining options across campus. A recent investigation from the Allegheny County Health Department revealed a plethora of food safety violations. After fifteen students contracted a food-borne illness, the university has sworn to improve hygiene in all of its dining halls. Negotiations with the cockroach union are already underway, with lead negotiators stating that they believe soon only the cleanest of vermin will be allowed inside kitchens. In addition, the Underground is planning to hire new food-tasters to ensure everyone’s meal will be completely free of E. coli.. University water will also be tested regularly to ensure that the levels of lead remain only slightly above acceptable levels.\r\n\r\nThe higher tuition is also going to be used to revamp Carnegie Mellon’s merchandise. CMU has decided to partner with various luxury brands for their all-new clothing line. “We want to show our students that anyone, regardless of financial status, can have the opportunity to wear high-end brands at Carnegie Mellon,” stated President Jahanian. “Carnegie Mellon is an equal opportunity school: anyone with enough smarts and dedication can attend. That’s why we want all of our students to have access to obscene displays of wealth.” When asked about CMU’s repeated refusals to recognize a graduate student union or increase funding to the Humanities department, Jahanian reportedly put his fingers in his ears and pretended he could not hear the reporter. So while CMU may not be increasing funding for adequate mental health support, students and faculty will be receiving a 5% discount on the new CMU x Gucci shirts. Prices will be starting at $500 per item of clothing.",

    "title": "Bio-Computing at CMU Promises to Revolutionize Queer Literature",
    "body": "“It is sacrilege that anyone graduating from Dietrich as an English major could even consider the possibility of having a stable career” – Unnamed Computational Biology researcher.\r\nWith the unveiling of ChatGPT-4o early this summer, along with constant daily advancements in AI technology, artists are feeling mounting pressure as their faith in their job security crumbles. Sure, much of the movie scripts and visual art produced by AI is inferior as they lack the elevated human touch of real art created by real artists, but it’s not like the corporations who would hire you give a shit. There is, however, one last barrier that AI hasn’t yet satisfactorily breached, the final frontier of AI art: poignant queer literature. This might’ve put some Dietrich students at ease, but bio-computing at CMU has recently announced its plan to be the spearhead that pierces through this barrier.\r\n\r\n“At first, the problem seemed impossible to solve”, says Dr. Harry Q.E.D Bovik, an AI researcher at CMU who asked to remain anonymous, “despite the rapid advancement of AI, queer literature was something we just couldn’t get our models to learn from and write in a way that truly resonates with the queer community.” Just as Dr. Harry Quagmiry Bovik's dream seemed hopeless, his indomitable human spirit pushed through, refusing to simply accept the status quo of Dietrich graduates merely struggling to find work, to ensure that Dietrich students will never be employed, Dr. Harry Quantum Bovik’s came up with an ingeniously simple idea and is now collaborating with bio-computing at CMU researchers to build upon it: all queer authors write about the experiences of being, metaphorically, a rat. Queer people are rats, this is an established truth, just ask any of your queer friends. Knowing this, bio-computing at CMU is in the process of growing rat neurons to train them to distinguish literature written by the good queers from the bad ones, and eventually produce completely original high-quality queer literature.\r\n\r\n“As an ardent reader of queer works, both analytical and philosophical, as well as hot gay vampire smut, I am excited to receive the works from this project. The current problem with queer literature is unfortunately they’re being written by actual queers, and the companies sponsoring my research hate that”, says Dr. Harry Quarter-dollar Bovik. While interviewing Dr. Bovik, we also received comments from his colleagues at bio-computing. Most of these comments were just frenzied insults hurled at Dietrich students and alumni; this went on for another two hours and forty-seven minutes before we received any useful input, “More frequent literature is a nice cherry on top, but of course our main goal has always been to make sure Dietrich graduates never earn more than starvation wages”.\r\n\r\nThe first drafts of the first works to come from this project are estimated to come out two months from now. The public can expect to read these works before the end of 2025.",

    "title": "Ranking CMU's presidents",
    "body": "<b>Arthur A. Hamerschlag</b> (1903–1922): As Carnegie Tech's first president, Hamerschlag was a visionary. He oversaw the school's transition from a trade school for young people in industry to a four-year college, which is widely regarded as a mistake. Despite overseeing CMU's original sin, he Hammed his Schlag so hard that this university survived another century, and for that, he deserved to be our first <b>S tier</b> president.\r\n\r\n<b>Thomas S. Baker</b> (1922–1935): CMU's official website describes Mr. Baker as \"giving Carnegie Tech a chance to breath,\" a typo which is ironic in light of Baker Hall's close connection with CMU's English department. Baker's most significant improvements to campus seem to have been trees and sidewalks, possibly as an attempt to allow the forest to reclaim campus. An admirable effort, but he's solidly in <b>B tier</b>.\r\n\r\n<b>Robert E. Doherty</b> (1936–1950): Doherty took over CMU in the midst of the Great Depression. This would not be CMU's last encounter with depression. Despite his clear leadership in one of the most trying times in American history, including through the Second World War, his name is now primarily associated with the worst building on campus. I put Doherty in <b>B tier</b>.\r\n\r\n<b>John Christian Warner</b> (1950–1965): John Warner purified the plutonium for the Manhattan Project. Under Warner's administration, the first business school on CMU's campus opened its doors. The building named after Warner is a monotonous block of brown glass, with a lavish interior clearly deducted directly from students' tuition. John Warner is no friend of mine. <b>D tier</b>.\r\n\r\n<b>H. Guyford Stever</b> (1965–1972): As one of CMU's shortest-serving presidents, Stever made an outsized impact. He oversaw the merger between Carnegie Tech and the Mellon Institute, the closing of the women's college, and the creation of four of CMU's seven colleges. Stever starts with an S, and so it's only fair to give him <b>S tier</b>.\r\n\r\n<b>Richard M. Cyert</b> (1972–1990): Under Cyert, CMU rose to prominence as a pioneer of computing and a world-class institution. Though his strong vision for the future of CMU was as influential as it was ambitious, he got the short end of the stick with the building given his namesake. Cyert Hall is a building few have entered, and one which will have you asking, \"why am I doing this?\" This is the same question one would ask in Cyert himself. Overall, Richard Cyert earns a respectable <b>A tier</b>.\r\n\r\n<b>Robert Mehrabian</b> (1990–1997): Mehrabian made a highly visible, and highly questionable, mark on the physical layout of campus. Under his supervision, Gesling Stadium was rotated 90° for a second time, the bafflingly designed and wildly overpriced University Center was built, Roberts Engineering Hall grew like a tumor from the western side of Hamerschlag, and the East Campus Garage blighted our campus with car-centric infrastructure. History will not be kind to Robert Mehrabian, and neither will I. <b>C tier</b>.\r\n\r\n<b>Jared L. Cohon</b> (1997–2013): Jared Cohon was a guiding force in CMU's growth during one of the most dynamic times in history, overseeing CMU through the rise and fall of pop-punk and mallcore. Cohon has the longest online biography of any CMU president by far, though it has an outsized focus on his personal accomplishments. I do not think it would be controversial to place Cohon firmly in <b>A tier</b>.\r\n\r\n<b>Barack Obama</b> (2008–2016): Barack Obama was a flawed president, as many have taken the opportunity to point out, but his message of hope and his clearly voiced support for our nation's best impulses will stand out as a last gasp for normalcy in a flailing democracy. Under Obama's tenure, the Tepper School of Business grew substantially, including through the construction of the Tepper Quad, but little else changed significantly. This might be a controversial take, but I'm putting Obama in <b>B tier</b>.\r\n\r\n<b>Farnam Jahanian</b> (2017–Present): Farnam Jahanian is, without question, the best president in CMU history. Farnam has watched over CMU in a time of great growth and change, and has been a stabilizing force in times of distress. I particularly hope that due to my praise, Farnam will personally write off my tuition. <b>S++ tier</b>.",

A new trend has emerged amongst Tartans, primarily English, Art, and Psychology (they can’t fix themselves) majors, which has been dubbed “rawdogging bungee jumping”. This sport is just like regular bungee jumping, but with one small caveat – interviewing one student actively involved in this community, Benner Haroldt Rogers: “We straight up rawdogging this shit, no music, no bungee cords, no nothing. Just me and the laws of Physics”. But why would anyone want to jump off a bridge or a cliff or a tall building without a bungee cord? Doesn’t that defeat the whole purpose? It doesn’t, as per Tyan Beatrice “Wetham” Rosh: “A bungee cord… it takes away the feeling, y’know?”. How this trend emerged I do not know, nor its survival into the future can Ipredict, however I have found that the current most popular vantage points for taking the leap is the top of Warner Hall (Farnam is a rawdogger too!), Panther Hollow Bridge (go Panthers!), and the “Architect's leap”.",

    "body": "### 1) Better at news \r\nUnlike The Tartan, which operates on the ideas that journalism should be \"fair\" and \"unbiased\", readme is the only campus news source that includes fun quips interesting comments, and other eccentricities. \r\n### 2) Better words \r\nFind me a single example of the Tartan using the word \"eccentricites\". You can't. We're simply better. \r\n### 3) Lack of a sports section \r\nConsidering how much we here at Carnegie Mellon dislike sports, atheltics, and the general existence of non­academic endeavours, readme stays true to the original vision of Carnegie Mellon by ignoring any and all sports news. The Tartan, instead, has a bozo co­editing the section. \r\n### 4) We're monetized \r\nWhile the Tartan has to strugle for advertisements and soliciations, we're one of the hottest advertising commodities on the market. Sure, companies willing to buy space with us are usually shady, but hey, it keeps the lights  on and lets me pay for tuition, so it works. \r\n### 5) We host events \r\nTechnically. Well, technically, KGB holds events, and we advertise them. That's because we're cool. And you want to be cool right? Who even reads newspapers anymore. \r\n### 6) At least half of us are fully illiterate \r\nI barely passed the fourth grade. \r\n### 7) We're the fastest way to get a criminal record \r\nYou tell me how many crimes the Tartan helps you commit. None at all. Buncha nerds. Bet they're fuckin' narcs too. \r\n### 8) We're not owned by CMU \r\nUnlike the Tartan, which bends to the whims of the talking ghost of Andrew Carnegie, readme only answers to God, the KGB, and whoever is currently funding us. \r\n### 9) We stop when we're out of ideas \r\nThe Tartan has been publishing for a hundred years. Really? How much fucking stuff has happened on campus since 1924? Not enough for a newspaper. readme, on the other hand, stops once we run out of ideas. Like right now. Think I had more of these?

It was a tough decision; on one side we have a candidate who did not fall out of a coconut tree, and on the other side, we have the star of the beloved Christmas movie \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.\" Despite the strong partisan contenders, we have decided to endorse an independent candidate: our very own Wean Hall.\r\n\r\nWean Hall, built in 1971, is a 9-story brutalist structure just off of the Mall. Its running mate is Doherty Hall, built in a beaux-arts style so long ago that CMU doesn't seem any more certain than \"the early 1900's.\" Doherty Hall is known for being old, confusing, and disorienting, which should be familiar to today's voters. The two have been attached at the hip since Wean Hall was built, so it comes as no surprise that they're sharing the ticket this election.\r\n\r\nWean Hall has promised that it has a \"concrete plan\", which has been criticized as \"full of holes.\" Some of its policies include a strong pro-immigration stance, \"as long as they pay tuition.\" When asked about the Israel-Palestine conflict, Wean Hall had this to say: \"I strongly support the Starbucks boycott. I'm a La Prima kind of building.\" One policy which even we at Readme struggle to back is its support of increased plastic waste in the ocean. \"People say I look like a turtle,\" a hidden microphone captured Wean Hall saying. \"I actually fucking hate turtles.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Wean Hall is a minor independent candidate at the moment, it's rising in the polls, and will face off against a worthy opponent tonight. A lively discussion is in store for us in a debate with William Henry Harrison, who's back on the Whig ticket. Despite its lack of political experience, Wean Hall has many underground connections, including to Scott, Newell, and Simon.",

    "title": "Inside ReadMe Legal",
    "body": "Due to the substantial inquiries regarding the inner workings of ReadMe & Co, I have been chosen to represent the ReadMe Legal Department in disclosing the functions and responsibilities we adhere to in order to maintain ReadMe as a corporation and ensure the continued freedom of all ReadMe employees.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant duties of our department is to navigate the bureaucratic Red Tape[1] necessary to ensure ReadMe, the flagship newspaper and namesake of ReadMe & Co, maintains its status as a satirical newspaper and the legal protections that come with it. Of course, similar to most legitimate media outlets, ReadMe & Co. achieves this through the creation and deployment of several lobbying firms across the U.S. and its territories as well as the employment of private contractors to engage in persuasive acts with key political figures. Because of our status as a corporate entity, ReadMe & Co also invests hundreds of thousands of dollars into various Super PACs to ensure overwhelming political support in our endeavors. Our CLO, Sir. Maximillian Bartholemow VIII, has even gone so far as to release an official statement underscoring our commitment to ensuring these program have ample funding: “Our bribery [political investment] campaign has done so well that I have made the executive decision to half the salaries of all employees of the ReadMe Record Management Bureau (RRMB) to subsidize it”[2]. This ingenious maneuver had the added benefit of causing over half of the employees of the RRMB to quit, bolstering our bureaucratic relations as we are now able to cite the understaffing of the RRMB as reason to delay and deter[3] investigations from institutions acting on behalf of state, federal, and foreign governments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the department’s resources go into bureaucratic relations, most ReadMe Legal staff spend their time protecting ReadMe & Co and its employees from malicious litigation. Every[4] employee at ReadMe & Co is assigned a personal Litigation Manager (LM) from the ReadMe Legal Department. Each LM is responsible for acting on behalf of their assigned employee in all legal matters and are thus entitled to unrestricted access to that employee’s belongings, habitable spaces, and third-party accounts (email, credit card, etc.).  Because it is the priority of our department to perpetuate the freedom of all employees, LMs are highly incentivised to exercise extreme competence through a joint-punishment clause in their contracts agreeing to share all civil and criminal sentences with their assigned employee.\r\n\r\nThis policy is not without fault, however, as the LMs for the staff involved in the biweekly shooting of Benner Rogers[5] find the workplace disproportionately more stressful than other staff. To remedy this, ReadMe & Co. will be adding a pool table to the staff lounge at the end of this quarter. However, in response to several complaints from Rogers’ close friends and family, the ReadMe Legal Department found the Board of Murdering Benner (BoMB)[6] and has already established relations with a contracting firm that specializes in post-mortem rehabilitation. On the urging of our CLO, BoMB will also be allocated resources to assist in the deployment of mechanical devices capable of remotely creating localized sudden and drastic changes in air pressure. This should greatly assist in negotiation efforts with authorities on Benner Rogers related matters henceforth.\r\n\r\nIt is the hope that in divulging some of the inner workings of ReadMe Legal, we have provided a worthwhile educational experience to the public[7] and alleviated any concerns for the safety and security of ReadMe & Co and its employees. We also hope that this article will act as compliance to any and all current and future subpoenas into the operations of ReadMe Legal. Regardless, we believe that ReadMe Legal is capable of defending ReadMe & Co for the foreseeable future and can ensure that you can continue to rely on ReadMe for your authentic news[8].\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that bureaucratic tape is referred to as red to appeal to the common idiom and not to mislead the public on the processes involved in dealing with bureaucratic institutions. If tape was used in one of these processes, we admit that it would most likely be a faded shade of yellow.\r\nSir. Maximillian Bartholemow VIII denies ever making this statement.\r\nThe use of ‘delay and deter’ to describe the state of the ReadMe Record Management Bureau and their work with regards to investigations into ReadMe & Co is purely hyperbolic. ReadMe & Co does not intend for the means of record keeping to be used to actively interfere with ongoing investigations, but merely lacks the proper resources to ensure records are kept in an organized manner.\r\nThis excludes employees in the legal department.\r\nReadMe & Co denies all allegations of involvement of any of its employees in the alleged murder of Benner Rogers. We further deny the existence of any former employee by the name of Benner Rogers and allege that no word (let alone crime) by the name of “murder” exists within the English lexicon.\r\nThe use of the word “murder” in the title of BoMB is purely satirical and is in no way an admittance of guilt in the alleged murder of Benner Rogers.\r\nBy reading this, you agree that you have in fact learned something and will testify as such if ReadMe & Co should pursue a tax write off for all resources allocated to the creation of the material you have consumed.\r\nThis is false.",

We were originally founded in 1992, when Jim McDougal, Terry Former, Elle Forest, and that Scooter \"Skip\" Hoodwinkle decided to meet in the deep recesses of the Doherty A level and think up an idea nobody had ever thought about before ­ could Carnegie Mellon students be funny? Unfortunately, during this meeting, Skip cracked the first ever joke told on CMU campus, leading to two hospitalizations and  the death of Jim McDougal from excessive laughter. The tragic result of this meeting delayed the foundation of readme until the early 2000s, where as a response to the attacks on September 11, 2001, Carnegie Mellon students once again attempted to be funny, but this time, to heal the nation. readme had a great run from 2000-­2017. The magazine was a favorite of many dictators across the world, and Vladimir Putin called the August 2017 issue \"the funniest thing he read since he threw his last political rival out the window.\" Similarly, Saddam Hussein requested a copy of readme prior to his execution in 2006. However, outside pressure led to our publication being dissolved for \"excessive propogandization\", though rumors have it a few issues are still in circulation in North Korea. A few of our members were expelled. Most of the rest were arrested, and had to finish their 122 final in jail. Luckily for us, it only took a few years for us to get picked up by the KGB. They helped rebuild the magazine from scratch, leading to our re­establishment in 2024, with a new message. We hope to be honest, truthful, informative, and above all else, entirely fucking useless. Without further ado, the *Carnegie Mellon KGB* presents...\r\n\r\n\r\n# _**readme, issue #1**_",

Enjoy these thorough, accurate, and detailed reviews of popular titles. \r\n\r\n50 Shades of Grey: 10/10. This wonderful collection of paint samples was a great help to me when deciding what color to paint my dorm room. The author has compiled a lengthy list of beautiful shades for interior and exterior decorators alike.\r\n\r\nPart 1 begins with a section of nearly-white shades, gradually fades into bright winter grays, and finishes with a set of dry stone hues. This thrilling beginning keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. The absence of protagonist, antagonist, or plot at all does nothing to dampen the excitement, and in fact, only increases the suspense. \r\n\r\nPart 2 echoes the first by starting out with a lovely Coventry Gray, moving quickly into the famed Gosling Grey, a timeless classic. The book takes a sharp twist midway through, however, by diverting to shades of blue-gray, an unexpected addition by the author. This alternate storyline continues with green-grey and even some brownish hues, but eventually makes its way back to a Classic French Gray. \r\nPart 3 finishes the book by transitioning a dark, serious, Harbor Gray into a near-black Charcoal Grey. From start to finish, the book provided plenty of excitement and anticipation, leaving the reader wondering what new shades of grey will be arriving in the expected sequel, 50 More Shades of Gray. \r\nStay on the lookout for “The Color Purple” in the next issue!\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nJames and the Giant Peach: 3/10.

Being an editor for the premier comedy, satire, and news publication sounds glamorous, but in reality it is a hell I would not wish upon my worst enemy.\r\n\r\nAvid fans of readme know that we publish bi-weekly on Wednesdays. This means we print and distribute copies of readme on Tuesday evenings. I have just been informed that we are not publishing on Wednesday this week. Is this a sign from god that he finally loves me? In an ideal world everyone would have a rough draft of their content in by Sunday night. Does this happen? NO. Every two weeks like clockwork, articles slink into the drive on Monday. Every time this happens I am reassured that next issue we will enforce a strict Sunday night deadline. Does this happen? NO.\r\n\r\nI have a family <i>[Editors node: we are unable to fact check this claim, he just spawned here one day and hasn’t left.]</i> My mother hasn’t heard from me in a year. My doctor thinks I’m developing scurvy because all I do all day is sit here and beg people to send me articles. I haven’t seen the outside in months. Please free me.\r\nYou would think that when we finally publish each issue, my torment might end LIES. I, by virtue of being the only person in this organization who can do anything in a remotely timely manner, also manage our website content ( you should go check out cmureadme.com. It’s a good website). I pride myself on uploading all of our content to the website day of. You’d think this would be simple. NO. We have a shared Google Drive folder, yet each week without fail there is an article or image that is just missing from this folder. I then get to embark on the lovely process of hunting through Discord messages to locate these treasures.\r\n\r\nEvery week I am promised that the next issue will not be done in a last minute rush. I am Sisyphus, and the timely publication of this dear magazine is my boulder. \r\n\r\n<i>Editor's note: Guys I swear this magazine runs on a very reasonable schedule.

    "body": "As a former freshman, I know that most of you are coming into CMU with one goal in mind: marriage. You may think this is a far-fetched dream, but by winter break, your peers will be proposing left and right. Enormous patches of grass on the Mall will die from being crushed by all the knees of hopeful romantics popping the question. If you’re lucky, you’ll be on one side of this ritual or the other before March rolls around. If you’re unlucky, you’ll have to watch droves of men (and lesbians) dropping to their knees and wonder: “when will it be my turn?” Fear not: according to the Common Data Set, 95 percent of CMU students become engaged or married before the end of their first year of college. Anthropologists struggle to explain this phenomenon, with one saying, “We have no idea how this keeps happening. There’s no purity culture to speak of, but CMU’s students consistently seem eager to rush into marriage regardless. We suspect that students are afraid that if they don’t enter a committed relationship by the end of their first year, it’s never going to happen.” \r\n\r\nAnd evidence shows that those fears are justified. CMU’s first year outcomes page, which shows students’ outcomes in the first year after graduation, shows that 95 percent of CMU students are engaged or married within a year after they graduate, meaning of course that not a single student gets engaged past their first year. Which means if you miss your shot in freshman year, you’ve got nothing to look forward to. \r\n\r\nThis “ring by spring” culture, as sociologists have called it, has been found to create stress amongst freshmen but greatly improves the morale of upperclassmen—or at least the 95% lucky enough to participate. For those who aren’t, depression abounds, life is hopeless, and nothing will go right ever again. “I think that’s an overreaction,” says a friend of the author. “I know she’ll get herself right eventually. She’s already starting to pull herself back together in her classes, even if she has to break down crying every weekend about how she’ll always be alone and no one will ever love her.” While parts of these claims are accurate, their implications are disputed.",

You think you’re so smart, going back over every little thing you said and believing that you did okay. I won’t play your game. It’s something <b>about you.</b> Traits. Hobbies. Mannerisms. Beliefs.

Once closely analyzed, a CMU forensics team discovered that the plank was in fact being lifted, but by a 19 year old in camoflage, disguised perfectly against the CFA parking lot.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation revealed something shocking: CMU's own detachment of the Army ROTC had been building an unauthorized booth entry, months before the start of the competition.

By the time CMU police arrived, the ROTC booth had existed long enough that the cadets claimed squatter's rights, which they successfully defended in court.

    "body": "<span class=\"c6\">__1. Introduction__</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Rock paper scissors, also known as scissors paper rock, and rarely ever referred to as paper rock scissors, is a game typically played between two people, where one match of rock paper scissors (RPS) consists of both players throwing out a hand gesture at the same time after a brief countdown. These hand gestures represent a rock, paper, or a pair of scissors, respectively (some variants also allow for other objects, such as guns. However, we will only be considering the usage of actual guns to gain a tactical advantage). Rock beats scissors by </span><span>denting</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;them, scissors beats paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by wrapping itself around the rock. Oftentimes, competitive games of RPS take the form of best-of-three matches, though quick one-of matches are commonplace when it is necessary to decide a &ldquo;winner&rdquo; of something between two people, and a coin-flip isn&rsquo;t an option.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Given the nature of the game, one might prematurely assume that winning a match of RPS is no different to winning a coin flip. It is seemingly impossible to anticipate the move of your opponent and develop a counter strategy, as it is usually equally likely that your opponent has actually chosen the perfect counter strategy to your counter strategy, resulting in an impasse. This is the pitfall that many new, and even experienced players of RPS face. This paper highlights a new strategy, guaranteeing victory in a match of RPS once the prerequisites are satisfied, which is accessible to even those new to the deceptively simple game of RPS.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">The authors hold no responsibility for the possible ramifications of following the strategy outlined in this paper, possible ramifications including: loss of friendships, imprisonment, death, and in extreme cases, losing your game of RPS.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c23 c6\">__2. Important Definitions__</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Before detailing the strategy, it is important to define a handful of other terms that will be referenced throughout the strategy guide, as some of these terms may initially be unfamiliar to those who are only familiar with the game of RPS, and nothing else.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">__2.1__</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c23 c6\">__Associate__</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>An item or living being is an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate </span><span>of somebody if there is a close relationship from this &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; to the item or living being in question. This relationship need not be reciprocated. Using John Doe as an example, some </span><span class=\"c5\">associates </span><span class=\"c3\">of his may include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_p5ysb340a1bo-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His wife, Jane Doe. They were high school sweethearts, she being captain of the cheer team, and John the charming and well-liked quarterback of the American football team. Despite the fact that Jane&rsquo;s opinion of John has diminished ever since she had to quit college to move across the country with John, John&rsquo;s continued perception of Jane as being &ldquo;better than nothing&rdquo; qualifies Jane as an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His drinking buddy, Giles Corey. They became fast friends in college, and continued their relationship despite John&rsquo;s sudden move across the country due to the ailing health of his parents, as Giles happened to live in the same area. The locals regard them as partners in crime due to their raucous behavior when intoxicated. Because most nights, John spends his time with Giles rather than with his wife Jane, Giles is considered an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His childhood hamster, Jeremy. Even though Jeremy has long since been deceased, Jeremy was the only other (formerly) living being that John would proclaim he loved unconditionally, the one other living being the aforementioned Giles Corey. Oftentimes, deceased individuals would not qualify as associates, however, because John would likely be incredibly shocked at the sight of Jeremy&rsquo;s remains, Jeremy is considered an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John&rsquo;s.</span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c23 c6\">__2.2 Intimidation__</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>While the feeling of being intimidated is a primal emotion that many of us have had the misfortune of feeling, seldom do people get the opportunity to be the ones intimidating. </span><span class=\"c5\">Intimidation</span><span>&nbsp;is any series of actions, or any one solitary action, that makes the target(s) feel intimidated. Continuing to use the example of John Doe, examples of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation </span><span class=\"c3\">include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_a3xgynthnks8-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Holding Jane Doe, John Doe&rsquo;s wife, hostage. The later section will highlight in greater detail ways to hold someone hostage. By sending a picture of Jane in a position of danger, John will feel intimidated, thus this is a successful instance of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Threatening to reveal the nature of John and Giles&rsquo; close relationship to Jane. Although Jane is no longer as infatuated as she used to be with John, this will still result in John feeling intimidated as he wonders how you gained this information, thus this is an example of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Leaving the remains of Jeremy at John&rsquo;s doorstep, ideally after 6:00 PM on a weekday, as if Jane were to see these remains when she returns home from work, she&rsquo;d dispose of them without any further questioning. This timing would be crucial to ensure that Jane does not interfere with the presence of Jeremy and that John will be able to see these remains. John will feel intimidated regardless, but it is also worth noting that this </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;attempt will be more effective if Jeremy&rsquo;s corpse is somehow preserved, so it is immediately apparent that the remains are that of Jeremy, and not any small rodent. </span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">__2.3 Fear__</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Ultimately, it is difficult to assuage whether an attempt of intimidation is successful without understanding the meaning of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>. This section will try to briefly establish the concept of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>, for the lucky few that are unfamiliar. Departing from the story of John Doe, some examples of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear </span><span class=\"c3\">include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_g10crlnefzgn-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>You return to your childhood home that you have lived in since you were born for spring break. College was the first time you were ever away from home this long, and you hope that this break is as rejuvenating as fall break was. However, you find that your parents often forget your name, and it takes multiple attempts for you to get their attention. When you do have their attention, the only expression you ever see on their faces is a wide grin which takes care to only expose a modest amount of pearly white teeth. When you are not in their immediate line of sight, they stand motionless, the same expression on their face. Every night, when your mother tucks you into bed and kisses you on the forehead, her clenched teeth pressing against your skin, you may feel </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Everyday that your parents leave for work, you feel </span><span class=\"c5\">relief</span><span>. However, on a sunny Wednesday afternoon, when you wake up and go through the motions of your morning routine, you realize that there is now an extra door leading from your bedroom, matching exactly that of the bathroom door. When curiosity gets the better of you, and you enter this new bathroom, only to find yourself reentering your bedroom from the normal bathroom door, you feel </span><span class=\"c5\">perplexed</span><span>. Then, when this extra door is nowhere to be found, and the door behind you shuts and locks the moment you are no longer in the doorframe, you may feel </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">. </span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">While you wander the unfamiliar new halls of your childhood home and your sense of time slips away, you notice how you don&rsquo;t recognize the smiling child in any of the childhood photographs your parents had so lovingly hung up throughout the house. The child&rsquo;s grin is far too wide, and despite you distinctly remembering having braces at that age, its teeth are pearly white. After descending the basement stairs to return to your bedroom on the second floor, you try the bathroom door once more to find it unlocked. As you reenter the bathroom, and look at yourself in the mirror. A wide grin can&rsquo;t help but stretch its way across your face with glee, as you have finally made it to the bathroom to begin your morning routine. The first step of your routine is to count the number of teeth you have. Identifying the emotion you feel as you do so is left as an exercise to the reader.</span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">__3. The Strategy__</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Regarding RPS as purely a game of chance results in a game with little strategy to be had. However, understanding the many psychosocial dynamics that are at play in society are key to determining a winning strategy for RPS. These strategies usually require some amount of knowledge about the person you are competing against, such as knowledge of their </span><span class=\"c5\">associates</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;(defined above), however, a general strategy is also included in case this knowledge is for whatever reason unobtainable. This paper will not go into detail as to how to obtain such information.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">__3.1 A General Strategy__</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">This strategy is to be used when very little information is known about your opponent, and it is difficult to procure any information. It will be assumed that the opponent is a blank slate.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Materials list:</span></p><ul class=\"c19 lst-kix_sbbmm0bc8uli-0 start\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">A weapon</span></li></ul><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Procedure:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">There are two possible cases, depending on whether or not your opponent is capable of feeling emotion and pain:</span></li></ol><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-1 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c11 c16 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">If this is the case:</span></li></ol><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-2 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">Boast about your flawless track record with games of RPS to your opponent. Regardless of whether this is true or not at the time of boasting, this raises the chances of instilling a sense of helplessness into your opponent. Otherwise, this has a chance of instilling a false sense of ease in your opponent if they assume that you are bluffing. Either result is advantageous.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span>Point your weapon towards the opponent. If your weapon of choice has high firepower or is a bludgeoning weapon, point this weapon towards this head, as in society, brain damage is undesirable, and the brain is located in the head. If your weapon deals damage by piercing or otherwise cutting into the flesh, hold your weapon at chest level, to maximize the amount of vulnerable locations you threaten to strike. Most people do not walk around in suits of armor. If for whatever reason, you do not have a weapon, any other form of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;can be substituted here.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span>Proclaim the </span><span>move</span><span>&nbsp;that you will make. Rock is recommended. If your opponent is exhibiting great amounts of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">, it may prove further advantageous to instruct your opponent what move to make. Figure 1 (below) highlights what instruction to give your opponent depending on the move you claim you will make.</span></li></ol><a id=\"t.f4a7d4a41e0c028031ab9f3d5ee1244c1cc39ccf\"></a><a id=\"t.0\"></a><table class=\"c10 c24\"><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Your move</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Opponent&rsquo;s move</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Rock</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Scissors</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Paper</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Rock</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Scissors</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Paper</span></p></td></tr></table><p class=\"c8 c10\"><span class=\"c12\">Figure 1: Matchups in RPS that result in your victory</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-2\" start=\"4\"><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">Begin the countdown, and when it comes time to do so, make the move that you claimed you will make in step (iii).

In spite of this, this strategy is considered ideal because it avoids the risk of your opponent overpowering you when you </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidate</span><span>&nbsp;them, as advance preparation for your </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span>&nbsp;method ensures that your opponent will be overcome with </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>, and will also be powerless in undermining your </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;at that immediate moment.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>The overall strategy follows the same steps as in 3.1, replacing step (ii) with a different intimidation method, focusing on an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span>&nbsp;of your choice.

Surviving in the dog-eat-dog world of RPS is a matter of becoming the intimidator, as opposed to the intimidated (the eating dog, as opposed to the eaten dog, if you will). Ignoring this reality can be considered reflective of the losing attitude many hold towards life. However, nothing is truly up to the Great Random. Taking the weaknesses of your fellow man in mind, victory will not be clean, but it will be in your hands.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Further research is recommended in understanding how to guarantee victory against those without emotions or fear of mortality, such as against computers. Considering growing fears in society regarding a robot takeover, discovering a weakness of computers in the game of RPS can then be translated to strategies to prevent the computer uprising. If computers are truly made in our image, then they will fall the same way we do. Our human hands can only hope for perfection, but everything will fall short, even our treacherous machines.</span></p>",

    "body": "Wednesday morning, students across CMU campus awoke to an incredible email resting in their inboxes: “You’re done with finals!” \r\n\r\nSent from a gibberish address, the messages contained only roughly-scanned notes written on sheet paper. In large looping cursive text and taped-on Polaroids, these letters told students that their last commitments had all been completely taken care of. For some, final essays had been handed in days early, the letter jotting down a favorite cited peer-reviewed study that \"Might just tickle your fancy if you give it a read!” For others, letters contained a scored final exam: only ever a sign error away from perfect, and always enough to bring home the student’s coveted A. “That was a tough one,” many a letter would encourage, “I’m mighty proud of how hard you’ve worked!”\r\n\r\nThough no name was signed in the letter, most included a final picture: a scanned Polaroid selfie of a smiling, white-bearded old man, pointing at the student’s name on a laptop screen. Scrawled on each photo, a little note: “From your biggest fan!”\r\n\r\nStudents were beyond overjoyed. Many were left speechless: they approached a ReadMe staff member choked in tears, and collapsed asleep moments after presenting the email. Those with the energy to run home did so, sleeping for the first stint of over five hours in the last week. Students promised to leave gifts in their kitchens before heading out for break: cookies and chips, milk and now-unneeded Celsius cans, anything they could muster. These students went on their merry way with a fresh spring in their step: that was all this letter sender wanted in return.",

The assailant climbed onto the reindeer, Claus tweeted. \r\n\r\nWhen pressed for a response, NORAD claimed they were, “spreading Christmas joy for every little girl and boy.” Claus claims that spreading this information is incredibly dangerous, and may lead to his assassination, especially now due to his recent exposal of political beliefs. \r\n\r\nMore interestingly, Norad has exposed that Claus’s total flight emissions for 2023 amount to 8,293 tonnes, which is over 1,100 times higher than the average person's entire annual emissions. \r\n\r\nFlight tracking has also revealed that Santa routinely avoids poorer parts of major cities - such as Harlem in NYC - or entire cities themselves, as in the case of Detroit in 2022. Santa refused to comment on this information, routinely stating that the tracking itself is unconstitutional and harmful. \r\n\r\nSanta will appear in court this Wednesday because of the case and has agreed to let the judge sit on his lap.",

An FMS maintenance worker discovered their remains in the SCC office on the third floor of the UC, and autopsy reports state that they had likely been dead for weeks.\r\nWhile students and faculty are mourning the loss of several upstanding members of the CMU community, they're also relieved to have an answer as to why so many delays occurred during preparations for Booth. \"SCC was so slow to put out the form for booth chairs,\" one student stated on Midway. \"If I'd known the directors of Booth were skeletons lying on the floor of the UC, I would've been fine with the delays. They just need to communicate better.\"\r\n\r\nThe cause of the numerous deaths is still unknown, but there are some clues. Some orgs suspect foul play, especially in light of recent tensions between SCC and SDC over their suspiciously similar names. Others suspect a gas leak, which may explain the increasingly confused actions SCC took in their final hours, perhaps reflecting a gradual loss of consciousness due to asphyxiation.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Booth will continue, though further delays can be anticipated. Students took the opportunity prior to move-on to mourn the loss of SCC, as they waited half an hour past their scheduled times to be allowed onto Midway. CMU is urging students to remove their hard hats out of respect, and to drown their grief in copious amounts of alcohol during Carnival.",

    "body": "As Carnival comes nearer, SCC’s heart has been squarely in the work getting Midway ready for students, alumni, and lost geese to have a fun and safe experience. They’ve been toiling away for weeks, and here at Readme, we forgive them for their foolish tendencies, like their tardiness on literally all of the important deadlines (it’s hard to keep track with the time zones) or their cowardliness in the face of rain. SCC only gets about 17 inches of rain per year, in comparison to Pittsburgh’s 43. \r\n\r\nAs the building of booths on Midway continued, Readme checked up on SCC to make sure they knew what they were doing. SCC released this statement: “Now that we know what a booth is, we are prepared to inspect booths and dispense wisdom to the builders of Midway.” Of course, they're pretty far from the action, so they'll need their Midway watch shift to keep an eye on things for them. And if they don’t have the tools or PPE that builders need, tough luck. The city only gives them so much money. \r\n\r\nSCC is excited to have some awesome buggy races this year. While no SCC staff have seen a buggy in person before, they swear they know how the races work. One staff member reported “The much anticipated buggy races will be…wait what do you mean there are people inside? They chose to be there? Of their own free will?” SCC is reportedly revising their plans to have a “bumper car” category in Sweepstakes. \r\n\r\nWe thank Spokane Community College for their hard work and dedication to providing an amazing Carnival experience for the whole CMU community.",

    "title": "How to Acquire and Care for Schrödinger’s Cat",
    "body": "So you want to get a cat, but that’s too easy. You want a pet that exists in a superposition of living and dead- a pet that makes your science friends think you’re cool. Thankfully, there is a solution. Schrödinger’s Cat is becoming wildly popular amongst college students at medium-sized urban Western-Pennsylvanian universities, of which CMU is the most illustrious. While it may seem complicated to acquire one, Readme has you covered. We can’t guarantee that the cat will survive the ordeal you will put it through, but you’ll have the cat in your possession, that’s for sure. \r\n\r\nThe first thing you need to do is find a cat. Generally, these can be found in shelters, from breeders, in the Schlounge, and on the streets. These options vary in price range, type of cat, safety, vibes, and fluffiness, but it really doesn’t matter. Next, you’ll need to put the cat in a box. As I understand it, cats enjoy cardboard boxes- they delight in ignoring a new toy only to shower their affection upon a piece of pressed and dried wood pulp. Make sure it’s a decently sized box, because if by chance the cat is alive, it might want to roam around a bit. \r\n\r\nOnce the cat is in the box, add one flask of radioactive poison, attached to a Geiger counter such that if radioactive decay is detected, the flask is broken, poisoning and killing the cat. This poison is extremely easy to acquire, just ask Jeff behind the counter. Add some cozy touches to the cat’s new home by putting a litter box, a mouse toy, a scratching post, and some snacks into the box. \r\nOnce the cat is situated in its new home, close the box and don’t peek inside. Looking would spoil the fun. Now sit there and think about the cat. Is it dead? Is it alive? You don’t know. Bring your friends over to think about it too. \r\n\r\nNow that you’ve thought about the cat for a while, it’s time to feed it. The cat is simultaneously alive and dead at the same time, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, so by a simple calculation (an alive cat requires x cups of food, a dead cat requires 0 cups of food, take the average of the two), you should add x/2 cups of food to the box. Make sure to close your eyes while doing this, as observing the cat would resolve reality and therefore not be cool to your science friends. By the same logic, you should put a dish of water in the box. \r\n\r\nThere are a few tasks to perform in the case of a dead cat. Because the cat is simultaneously dead and alive, you’ll need to prepare for its funeral as you feed it, provide water, and entertain it. Order a nice headstone, dig it a decent grave (a recent study notes that 2’x1.5’x6’ is the optimal grave size for the average cat). Make sure to allow a good-sized opening at the top of the grave, because it needs to be able to leave, since it’s also alive. Tell your roommates that the kitty “went to go live on a farm”, because it would be insensitive to tell them the cat is dead. Apologize to your roommates for the hairball noises in the middle of the night, alive cats do that sometimes. \r\n\r\nSchrödinger’s Cat can provide a fun experience, companionship, emotional catharsis, and a box full of kitty litter for everyone.",

    "title": "Scotty Dog Cheating, Martha Is Speechless!",
    "body": "Once again, the cheating allegations cannot escape Scotty Dog who was seen leaving Schenley Park with Clifford the Big Red Dog in photos posted to X and Reddit by Paparazzi. However it seems these allegations are not just allegations as videos were taken of Clifford kissing Scotty Dog. Scotty Dog’s reaction also seemed to prove his guilt with him barking and charging at the camera to stop them from recording. \r\n\r\n**MARTHA IS OUTRAGED**\r\n\r\nConcerned fans began to tag Martha Speaks, Scotty’s current girlfriend, on the situation on X which caused her to say in a tweet that she was taking a break from social media. However, it is certain it is due to not wanting to post a hasty tweet on the current (or perhaps recently ended) relationship between her and Scotty Dog. We at README got an interview with Martha and were able to get a few questions in before she walked out and accused the reporter for being a “wannabe TMZ loser for the elderly” and “a stalker who cares too much about the love lives of dogs”. That’s mean of Martha to say because README is a very credible source of information and the reporter is not obsessed with dog romance. \r\n\r\n**TOTAL CONFESSION**\r\n\r\nIn a recent tweet published on Scotty Dog’s private X account, a red heart was posted which basically confirms cheating allegations because Clifford is red. Using trash left outside of Clifford’s home which included black dog hairs, Turner’s lemonade bottles and plaid wrapping paper, we at README have deduced that those two are certainly engaged in a secret love affair. But what reason did Scotty Dog have for cheating beside being a playboy?\r\n\r\n**THE UGLY TRUTH ABOUT SCOTTY DOG**\r\n\r\nWhile Martha was known for her red collar, she had actually switched to blue in recent years. Many fans suspect that this sudden relationship with Clifford is a stunt to bring more students to CMU. When Scotty Dog was dating Martha students felt the mismatching colors were off-putting for the CMU brand. Prospective students also thought the same thing and instead chose colleges where the couples matched the color scheme of the school. While blue is a color in the tartan, red is the distinctive CMU merchandising color. Since Clifford is red and CMU is red, this is a great relationship for Scotty Dog to get more students. As we know, the only thing Scotty Dog loves more than bagpipes, kilts, and Snoop Dogg is branding. That and charging outrageous amounts of money for tuition. \r\n\r\n**FUTURE**\r\n\r\nIt seems Scotty Dog’s love life is still so turbulent. In other news the reporter is no longer allowed to go back to the neighborhood Clifford lives in due to the neighborhood watch not appreciating investigative journalism. If you have any update PLEASE CONTACT README I’M BEGGING YOU. Go Tartans!",

Readme spoke with a member of the Carnegie Association of Networking and Involvement in Necessary Expenditures, who chose to remain anonymous for official Association purposes (and not because this reporter forgot to take their name). The spokesman was quick to clarify, “This endeavour is completely legal. There is no rule prohibiting a Scotty dog from driving a buggy.” \r\nIn response to criticism that a dog driving a buggy was too far fetched, the Association stated, “We were told it was impawsible for a dog to win buggy, but the Carnegie Association of Networking and Involvement in Necessary Expenditures doesn’t back down when it gets ruff.” In unrelated news, the Carnegie Association of Networking and Involvement in Necessary Expenditures has submitted a formal request for peanut butter and bacon treats at Carnival. \r\nCMU often has a shortage of small Asian women around Carnival time, so to the Carnegie Association of Networking and Involvement in Necessary Expenditures, it seemed natural to try something new. Readme attempted to look into past entries of other animals in buggy competitions, but was quickly informed we were barking up the wrong tree.\r\nMany Readme readers may be curious about the design of the buggy. Unconfirmed reports suggest the buggy may be painted in the style of Pittsburgh’s own Andy Warhowl. \r\nNo matter the outcome of the race, rest assured that Scotty will go down in buggy history as a “good boy.” Spectators are welcome to come cheer him on in the cutest race in CMU history.",

    "title": "The Scramble for Element 119: The Race Continues",
    "body": "The quest to discover new superheavy elements has in the past been analogized to a race. Since the discovery of berkelium, in 1946, scientists from various laboratories around the world have competed, and at times collaborated, to discover new elements, leading to a string of discoveries of element 97 up to element 118. This race, however, has slowed to a halt after the most recent discovery, element 117, tennessine, in 2009. In 2017, the director of Riken, Dr. Hideto En’yo, not only announced that the search for element 119 had begun, but that elements 119 and 120 would be discovered within 5 years.\r\n\r\nDear reader, if you are capable of performing basic arithmetic mathematics, which I believe you are capable of since you are a university student, you might notice that 5 years after 2017 is the year 2022. Also, if you the reader have checked the date recently, you may notice that we are currently in the year 2024. That is, in fact, 2 years after 2022. Clearly, the current approach to discovering new elements isn’t working, and Dr. Hideto En’yo has been lying to us all.\r\n\r\nNow, dear reader, you might be wondering what exactly is the process of discovering new elements. In a nutshell (not literally), researchers take one heavy element, such as berkelium, and then accelerate particles of another element, such as calcium, to bombard the first heavy element (this was how tennessine was discovered). With enough tries, and luck, this might lead to the creation of a new element. Sounds simple enough, right? At this point, dear reader, you might be wondering how exactly they accelerate these particles. Magnets are used to both steer the particles in a circular trajectory and accelerate them up to speed. Herein lies the problem. Magnets? What do you mean they use magnets to accelerate particles? By magnets, you mean those things people put on their refrigerators? Like fridge magnets? This was never going to work, they have played us for absolute fools, managing to convince us, the common person, to put our faith in them. Obviously, this method would never work, and the particle physicists of our time do not know what they’re doing.\r\n\r\nIs all hope lost? Will we never discover element 119? Fortunately, I have not just brought to you, the reader, the problem, but also the solution to this very problem. If magnets can’t accelerate particles up to speed, what can? Evidently, a lot of things (try lifting the weights in the Cohon Fitness Center using fridge magnets, then lift that weight yourself). The best candidate for a viable method, however, are track athletes. Imagine for a moment two athletes, one holding a particle of einsteinium, element 99, and a particle of calcium, then have these two athletes sprint into each other at full speed. Not only would this finally allow the particles to move at sufficient speed, but it would ensure that the particles actually collide with each other, as two athletes colliding is much more probable than hoping two unimaginably tiny particles can be steered into each other using magnets.\r\n\r\nDear reader, we have plotted our course for the future. I have already sent my proposal to all of the scientists currently working on discovering element 119 (my editor has informed me that I have left out one scientist in particular, but I swear that was an accident). Dear reader, if you begin training now, you might just be able to become one of the athletes involved in the groundbreaking discovery of element 119. Another benefit that hasn’t yet been mentioned is that most likely, the new element would be named after an athlete, someone people care about, instead of some lousy so-called scientist. This of course means that if you train enough, you might be said athlete and receive naming rights. For reference, you would have to be able to run at speeds of 30 million meters per second, which admittedly is difficult but is fully within the realms of human possibility. Good luck, dear reader, and see you on the periodic table.",

This will provide them hands-on experience with both programming and customer interaction.\r\n\r\nThe system will work as follows, students will be hired at any one of the many call centers located throughout India. From there, they will be tasked to call overseas customers and, with their computer science experience, provide quality technical support. Recent statistics show that over 75% of Microsoft laptops and computers in the United States are infected with some form of computer viruses, so the help these students can provide is invaluable. To make sure the students don’t attempt to commit any wrongdoing whilst doing tech support, another call center employee will also be on the call under a pseudonym (for anonymity) and will be remotely accessing the client’s machine to make sure no wrongdoing is being committed.\r\n\r\nStudents will be expected to find their accommodations and transportation. They are also advised to expect daily hour and a half long commutes, even if their accommodations are only three miles away. However, the call centers have promised that they will cover any rickshaw costs, with students only needing to bring a receipt from the service to get compensation.\r\n\r\nAny student who wishes to apply must have at least completed a course on the level of 15-122. In addition, mandatory training courses on how to do a Microsoft Tech Support accent and developing spice resistance are also required. It's also recommended that students who can't survive without steak, have pale skin, don't like livestock, don't like scamming the elderly, and are racist do not apply.",

    "body": "Early this week, SCS students would have been informed via email that a tenth of the SCS student are to be culled, and the email would have included details on how which students are selected to be put to death. Any SCS students who have not seen such an email are asked to urgently check their spam folder. The decimation of SCS, as a direct order from our Dark Lord Biden, is likely to commence before the next United States president-elect gets sworn into office on January 25. All SCS students are thus currently forbidden from leaving the country.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming Roman-legion-style decimation of an entire CMU college is a drastic measure following a ban on C, the programming language, and all of its variants, beginning this summer. Given this fact, the future massacre should not come as a surprise to most SCS students as many computer science courses at CMU still stubbornly refuse to adapt their syllabus to use a different programming language. Such flagrant defiance against law and order would not go unpunished by the government of this great nation, and killing one-tenth of all CS students at CMU was deemed an appropriate measure by President Biden, further stating in a recent press release that “[CS students] should be thankful that I am only executing ten-percent of them, I could just as easily personally kill all of them if I wanted to”.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that given the proximity of their major to CS, some ECE students might be included in the pool of execution candidates; ECE software majors, your days may be numbered—and not in the countably infinite sense.\r\n\r\nVarious students from different majors at CMU have expressed solidarity with the CS students, sympathizing with them for their predicament. Several creative writing major students have reached out to us for comment, saying that “it would be very difficult to write without the letter C.” Similarly, an underwater basketweaving major (yes this is a real major at CMU look it up) student commented expressed concerns towards the ban and punishment, “banning the sea? What do you mean? I need the sea, it’s my entire livelihood!”\r\n\r\nThere have been some immediate consequences from this ordeal. The CS department began drafting plans to replace C with Rust to prevent further unnecessary deaths. Opponents of this proposal argue that Rust is an unsuitable substitute because it “ruins metals” and “advances the trans agenda.”\r\n\r\nOne unforeseen consequence of this ordeal has been an uptick in petty crimes committed on CMU campus: the rate of littering has skyrocketed in a desperate bid by international students trying to be deported back to the safety of their home countries, narrowly avoiding the ten-percent chance of death.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime of waiting for their eventual deaths, students enrolled in SCS may be pleased to know that they are temporarily safe from death as although our Lord Joe Biden’s orders are absolute, there have been complications in enacting the punishment. The decision to kill 10% of SCS students may be straightforward, but the execution itself would require the representation of 0.1 in binary. Thus, the decimation will be indefinitely postponed until a computer capable of storing a string of binary digits with infinite length is developed.",

    "title": "CMU Computer Science has gone WOKE!",
    "body": "Imagine that you’re a new student at Carnegie Mellon University, and it’s your first day on campus. It has long been your dream to graduate from CMU’s prestigious School of Computer Science, and today marks the first step of realizing that ambition. You walk into Gates and look around with eyes full of curiosity and wonder, expecting to be inspired by CMU SCS’s great intellectual minds that will push the boundaries of computer science, dragging the world into an age of technological progress. But, as you approach your fellow computer scientists, hoping to discuss the absolute state-of-the-art discoveries within the field, a grisly fact makes itself apparent: CMU SCS has gone woke! Instead of talking about Rust or HolyC, they start purring and meowing at you. You have been surrounded by cat like femboys with their striped socks, short pleated skirts, and unbelievably slutty waists, beckoning you over like incubi. There is no space here for intellectual computer science discussions, and you may very well become one of them femboys if you linger any longer. \r\n\r\nThe above account isn’t a pure hypothetical: there are many such cases. As CMU continues to push for DEI in SCS, the level of wokeness in SCS has gotten out of hand. You may be fooled into thinking that DEI is harmless, but its push in SCS is much more insidious than you could ever imagine. As the woke agenda grows stronger, the very values that are foundational to the field of computer science are abandoned.\r\n\r\nFirst, a history lesson. Computer science is a modern application of mathematics, and when examining its history, it becomes clear that these fields have their roots in the Christian tradition. Notably, in Kings 7:13, which reads “And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.”, we see a calculation of the circumference of a circle. This passage implies an approximation of π = 3, which, although imprecise, is remarkably perceptive for the time, and the fact that this approximation continues to be used by engineers today is a testament to its value. This is proof that the Christian God himself revealed mathematics to man. Even more extraordinarily, this passage clearly references quantum computing, a field of research at the bleeding edge of computer science. One might be easily fooled into believing that the “cubits” being mentioned are only referencing the ancient unit of measurement based on the approximate length of the forearm, when in truth, the original Hebrew word may be alternatively translated to “qubit”, the fundamental unit of information in quantum computing. Therefore, we must be careful not to erase Computer Science’s single most important foundational principle: its connection to God.\r\n\r\nYet, it seems that SCS and the wider field of computer science had already abandoned its Christian roots. In fact, computer science has become so unbelievably woke that Alan Turing, hailed as the father of modern computer science, has abandoned these foundational Christian values by committing the two sins of being gay and committing suicide, after he was (deservedly, I might add) chemically castrated for his abominable sexuality.\r\n\r\nSo, what is it that God wants man to accomplish? How can we honor the Christian origins of computer science? God, the all-powerful creator of our universe, and hence the only source of objectivity, commands us to “Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it” as written in Genesis 1:28. It is therefore an objective and inarguable truth that the purpose of life is procreation and to subdue Earth. Yet, CMU SCS’s woke agenda denies this truth. Whilst, indeed, the direction that SCS is headed in isn’t necessarily incongruent with subduing Earth, as evidenced by my short fling with Earth, a so-called “nonbinary” submissive femboy I had met thanks to CMU Missed Connections, the other part of his command is simply impossible to fulfill. No matter how hard you try, and trust me, I've tried, you can NOT impregnate femboys; even if they’re deliciously sexy with their striped thigh highs, short frilly skirts, and eyelinered bedroom eyes, they simply will not get pregnant. Despite this, SCS keeps on insisting that I be attracted to these femboy programmers, even though I'm not even in SCS! This utter woke nonsense from SCS will assuredly lead to the fall of computer science and the West at large.\r\n\r\nIt is high time SCS returns to its Christian roots to ensure the steady evolution of the field of computer science. This viral wokeness, if left unchecked, could spell the downfall for CMU… nay, for all of Western civilization.",

    "title": "Jewish Space Lasers are SDC's newest buggy strategy",
    "body": "{{jewishbuggy.png}}\r\n\r\nLast week during rolls, SDC buggy unveiled their newest buggy: Greed. The new design features a shorter body and lower ceiling, as well as a front mounted laser cannon. Upon questioning by ReadmE on what the purpose of this laser was, SDC merely responded that it was classified. However, after some careful investigative journalism (that did not include trespassing), our brave journalists were able to pinpoint the intended use of the laser.\r\n\r\nAccording to internal SDC documents, the laser is able to get targeted wheels hot enough to burn them off of opposing teams' buggies. Additionally, CMU students are like cats, and when presented with a laser pointer will go ballistic. This advancement comes on the heels of SDC buggy’s latest scandal, where ████████  ████ with ███ using █████.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous SDC mech explained to READme that the new design was based on the revolutionary thinking of Marjorie Taylor Greene. “I remember her rant on Jewish Space Lasers causing the California wildfires and was inspired to put a laser on top of our buggy.” \r\n\r\nThe SDC public relations team would like to clarify that even though the idea was based off of a “Jewish space laser,” the buggy space laser is “non-denominational.“ Furthermore, SDC buggy would like to clarify that Greed “holds no ill will towards the Jews, and if they need to start another California wildfire anytime soon, Greed is more than happy to help out with a good cause.”\r\n\r\nReadme reached out to Sweepstakes to ask if this violated any rules. They responded that because the laser doesn’t generate any momentum for the buggy, it’s “perfectly legal.” When asking if firing lasers at other teams broke any safety regulations, Sweepstakes stated that there isn’t a policy explicitly banning buggy-mounted laser cannons.\r\n\r\nSome drivers are voicing concerns with this safety ruling. A FRINGE driver told reaDme: “I was perfectly fine cramming myself in a carbon fiber tube and going 35 MPH headfirst down a hill, but I draw the line at a laser pointer.” However, not all drivers are concerned with this new advancement. An APEX driver told readME that “there’s nothing to worry about, SDC is always disqualified before race day.”\r\n\r\nReportedly, CIA has already begun working on responses to this new buggy. Leaked messages show a machine gun mounted to the top of their buggy. A CIA spokesperson told readme that “this is purely defensive, and only a countermeasure.”",

    "title": "People who played Esther in a second grade Hebrew school play more likely to be happy, confident, and employed",
    "body": "Groundbreaking new research has revealed the single strongest childhood predictor of adult success in Jewish youth. Second grade students who in their Hebrew school Purim plays played Esther were found to be happier, more confident, and more employed than their less fortunate peers who played Vashti.\r\nVashti was the Persian king Ahasuerus’s wife, at least until Ahasuerus got so royally drunk that he banished Vashti for refusing to appear naked in front of all the partying men for his seven-day-long party. This is widely considered to be within the top three least normal things Ahasuerus did. This required him to find a new queen, for which he held a beauty pageant that the secretly-Jewish girl Esther won. Esther then proceeded to save all the Jews by convincing her famously morally-inclined husband to rectify his prime minister Haman’s decree to direct Persians to kill all the Jews, by allowing the Jews to fight back (because apparently cancelling the decree wasn’t an option). Esther is therefore widely regarded as cooler and more badass than Vashti.\r\n\r\nResearchers were intrigued by anecdotal evidence that second-grade Esthers were more successful than their Vashti counterparts. One example researchers examined was a former Esther who is now the CEO of a Silicon Valley startup which makes an app providing an AI-powered Jewish motherly figure for non-Jews. She balances her job with caring for her 18 children. Meanwhile, one of her classmates who played Vashti in that same fateful Purim play has been unemployed since being fired from a dreidel-making company several years ago for rigging the dreidels toward the ש side (the only bad side) out of pure depression. Furthermore, she only has 8 children.\r\n\r\nThis made researchers decide to investigate further with a scientifically rigorous study. Their methodology was to email Hebrew school teachers and ask about students from 10-20 years ago. The researchers commented they were surprised that the Hebrew school teachers could report on every last detail of every single one of their past students who had played Esther or Vashti.\r\n\r\nResearchers unequivocally found that Esthers were, in comparison with Vashtis, more likely to be happy, confident, and employed. They measured happiness via the Hebrew school teachers’ assessments on a scale from 1 to 10. This was a change in plan from asking Esthers and Vashtis to self-assess because “these teachers know everything about these people anyway; they’re basically Jewish mothers to all these kids.” Confidence was assessed by individually contacting Esthers and Vashtis, and then asking them to rank how well they perform on basic prayers. As all Jews who have attended Hebrew school are perfect at basic prayers after doing them thousands of times, researchers considered this a good proxy for confidence. \r\n\r\nMore research is needed to understand the causation behind this difference, but researchers already have theories. “Esther is the epitome of a strong feminine figure who accomplishes things and makes her husband reconsider certain poor decisions like getting a mohawk or allowing the killing of an entire people group. Meanwhile, Vashti would totally tell Ahasuerus to get a mohawk,” said one researcher.\r\nOne possibility is that traits affecting eventual life success of Hebrew school students already exist in second-graders, affecting the characters they would like to play and how teachers tend to cast them. Previous research on why every girl cast as Mordechai ends up being gay has leaned toward this explanation. Another possibility is that the second-grade Purim play itself is a transformative experience, with Esthers physically learning to be brave and stand up for what is right, and Vashtis disappointing not only their Hebrew school teachers but also their Jewish mothers.",

    "body": "It happened again. You were leaving the car, walking back home, when you encountered it: a squirrel (let’s call him Squeaky) standing only 4 feet away from you. \r\n\r\nYou take a step closer. Squeaky does not scurry away. You cower. Squeaky stares you down. You run away. \r\n\r\nDoes Squeaky have rabies? you ask yourself. No, Squeaky doesn’t. What does Squeaky have? Courage. Gumption. Chutzpah. Probably the confidence to make a phone call. Maybe even the confidence to leave a message. \r\n\r\nShouldn’t this squirrel (let’s call him Sir Nutsworth) be afraid of humans and cars? You are a human that just got out of a car. Surely you are the epitome of Sir Nutsworth’s nightmares. But no, Sir Nutsworth is calmly standing and looking at you with an expression that says, “I had a positive middle school experience.” And you, standing there pathetically, are afraid. Perhaps of Sir Nutsworth. Perhaps of your own ineptitude. \r\n\r\nHow do you remedy your self-worth when faced with a nonchalant squirrel? Your first instinct may be to insult Sir Nutsworth to make yourself feel better. You might try telling Sir Nutsworth that he sucks at burying acorns and that his colleagues wouldn’t want to run into him at a bar. Since Sir Nutsworth is secure in himself and his acorn burying abilities – and his colleagues all know he is the life of the party – this won’t work.\r\n\r\nInstead, remind yourself: you are a CMU student and this squirrel (let’s call him Squirrellock Holmes) is a squirrel. Tell Squirrellock (who is named after his grandfather, not the famed literary detective, if you’d even bothered to ask) how many APs you took in high school. Remember that you’ve won robotics competitions Squirrellock probably hasn’t even heard of. Skillfully bring up in conversations that Squirrellock probably couldn’t handle the number of units you're taking. Make sure that when you are bragging to your friends about how little sleep you get, Squirrellock is within earshot. Be confident. Be daring. Be fearless. \r\n\r\nOr just run away. That works too.",

Dr. Skivvies hopes this new program will boost grades by as much as 69%, and contribute to \"a more revealing understanding of academic success.\" \r\n\r\nThe workshop includes hands on demonstrations for how best to flirt with much older professors, as well as some wardrobe pieces provided free of charge from randomly selected School of Art students. At the end of the workshop, pamphlets were handed out that included instructions on the best arousal strategies for 122 TAs, with some of the top strategies being: avoiding segfaults in your code, mentioning how good Rust's ownership system is at every available opportunity, and wearing anything that exposes more than an inch of skin. \r\n\r\nOpponents to this workshop argue that the curriculum centers too heavily around the male gaze, with one student saying \"wearing tight cropped shirts works for some professors, but we need a greater representation of what female professors find attractive.\" Some have taken to solving this issue by wearing clothing that bears the face of a more attractive person, although SASC has not endorsed that technique.\r\n\r\nOne student who has taken the workshop and implemented the strategies called it \"really helpful\" and \"the only things keeping my QPA up.\"",

    "body": "{{second_shittier_donneradded.png}}\r\nWith the completion of the new Highmark Center for Wellness, CMU has successfully wrapped up yet another construction project. Needing a new project to collect alumni donations, CMU turns to their freshman housing. Hopeful Donner residents prayed that CMU would finally announce the destruction of Donner, however, this Monday CMU announced that it will begin construction on a new, shittier Donner. The new Donner, aptly named Downer will be constructed directly next to the current Donner, so Donner residents are reminded that it could always get worse. \r\n\r\nA competition was hosted among the architecture students to design a building just inhabitable enough to be zoned under student housing. Students were given 24 hours and unlimited cans of red bull. Current junior Eshaan Joshi’s design was selected. The building will have 9 total floors, 4 of which are sub-basements, each floor to represent one circle of hell. \r\n\r\nTo prevent constant flooding only the first floor will have bathrooms and water fountains. The space saved by having bathrooms on each floor will house amenities for the residents. The second floor will contain a practice space for Kiltie band, and the fourth floor will contain a completely blacked out study space for students taking 15-122. The third sub-basement will contain a game room featuring a ping pong table missing the net, a pool table, and random assortment of pool balls, and a vending machine that is never restocked. Each room will be just large enough to be feasible for a forced triple. Students who discover roaches in their room will be billed an extra $150 for housing extra tenets. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the construction of Highmark was $5 million over budget, so some expenses need to be cut in the construction of Downer. Thankfully CMU students already enjoy constructing buildings for booth, so this year's carnival theme will be the construction of Downer. Students will build the foundations of this new building over the weeklong period, and then CMU will hire a construction crew to finish the rest. The 4 students in civil engineering will be tasked with leading this project, while current architecture students have shifted their studio focus to building popsicle stick dioramas of the new building. This new building will not feature air conditioning or heating, to further cut back on costs. Downer will contain washing machines, but dryers are predicted to be added by 2030, to help spread out the cost.\r\n\r\nMany alumni are very excited about this project, especially those who lived in Donner, as they can now say they weren't assigned the shittiest housing on campus. Famous alum, David Tepper, has even agreed to donate a rotting whale carcass to serve as the new house’s mascot.",

    "title": "Small European Town Actually Not At All Romantic",
    "body": "This past summer, Carnegie Mellon ran its annual language immersion program in Italy. For the first time, the program was held in the small Italian town of Cappuccinovecchio, right between that place you forgot from tenth grade history class and that place you forgot from eleventh grade history class. In the past, the program has garnered rave reviews.\r\n\r\n“This program got me away from Pittsburgh, as advertised. I hate Pittsburgh, so I’m happy,” said one student. “I learned a lot of Italian words, like pizza, pasta, espresso, and merda,” reported another. “I love how many naked people there are in Europe,” said a third.\r\n\r\nBut this year, student reviews were less outstanding. “I wanted a romantic summer getaway to a beautiful and more importantly Instagrammable Italian destination,” one heartbroken student told Readmè. “Instead, I got heatstroke from the lack of ice in my coffee, couldn’t eat the disgusting fake Italian food, and don’t even have any STDs to show for it.”\r\n\r\nThe principal complaints from students mostly concern how dreadfully depressing and unromantic the town was. According to Google, Cappuccinovecchio has a population of 400 people, down from a peak of 4,000 people. The current median age sits at 65, which the same heartbroken student reported as “way too high.” The student then clarified, “I’m into old people, but not that old.”\r\n\r\nReadmè has been made aware of one particularly egregious incident in which the cohort of students was invited to a party at a local college student’s house. The students were expecting a basement rager with cheap beer and whatever the Italian equivalent to frat bros is, and were disappointed to instead find an 80th birthday party for the local college student’s grandmother with artisan wines and a knitting competition. Worst of all, the grandmother didn’t even have any sick stories from her time in the mafia.\r\n“If I wanted artisan wines,” yet another heartbroken CMU student told Readmè, “I would’ve gone to… actually yeah I probably would’ve still gone to Italy. But I like my alcohol cheap and shitty, so there’s that.”\r\n\r\nAmong those who traveled to Cappuccinovecchio was a heterosexual couple. During their interview with Readmè, the pair expressed their disappointment with how unromantic Cappuccinovecchio was, a far cry from the expectations they said were set by the Duolingo owl’s sexiness.\r\n“I thought there’d be baskets of flowers hanging from all the buildings, romantic street music at every corner, and lovely little bakeries,” the guy from the heterosexual couple told Readmè. “So you can imagine my disappointment when instead there was graffiti on all of the buildings, and only some of it was vulgar. Plus, the town was deserted, I got banned from the only bakery on day three for calling the owner’s daughter hot, and the whole town reeked.”\r\n\r\n“Wait, I kinda like how the place reeked. Are you not into that kind of thing?” asked the girl from the heterosexual couple angrily, which made the interviewer somewhat uncomfortable. The guy then shook his head, which made the interviewer slightly less uncomfortable. “Well then I don’t think we can be a couple anymore,” the girl said, and walked out. This made the interviewer very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the most unromantic aspect of Cappuccinovecchio may have been the dissolution of a couple, which, for the record, Readmè had absolutely nothing to do with. This, combined with general complaints about the program’s poor choice of location, led Readmè to investigate further.\r\n\r\nAfter a long, arduous investigation which consisted of sending a singular thirty-word email to the Italian immersion program director, Readmè can now report that the reason for the unromantic Italy immersion program was because of cost-cutting. In past years, the program had been held in Verona, famous for the notably successful romance between Romeo and Juliet. But this year, to make the program cheaper and more accessible to students, the program director lowered costs upon finding that CMU could simply buy one-Euro homes in Cappuccinovecchio. When asked what CMU’s plans were for these homes when summer programs are not in session, the program director said they were sitting empty. So dearest reader, if you know of any couples you want to break up, please email jyachtss@andrew.cmu.edu and we’ll arrange for a positively unromantic trip to Italy.",

But a few weeks into the school year, you'll notice them shying away. They won't seem as alive at parties. They'll sit quietly during board game night while everyone else laughs and makes joyful conversation. They might even crawl someplace dark and quiet, like a sick cat hiding under your bed waiting to die. Wondering why? Well, it might just be 122. \r\n\r\nTaking care of a friend with 122 is tricky. You want to communicate that you sympathize with them, but avoid sharing stories of your own intro course struggles or saying phrases like \"I understand what you're going through.\" Because if you do, Iliano can't find out, or it's an AIV. \r\n\r\nIt may seem like their life has been consumed. It's an early lecture, then office hours, practice problems, precepts, programming homework, more office hours, more programming homework, rinse and repeat. The best thing you can do for them is provide a stable outside perspective and a steady guiding force in the right direction. Push them into bodies of water if you can smell them from more than two feet away. Delete their laptop's bootloader configuration, forcing them to take time away from c0vm. Take them to a rave in an abandoned warehouse, call the cops, and slip fent into their pockets. \r\n\r\nWhat's most important to remember is that 122 doesn't last forever. At the end of the semester, your friend, crushed but finally free, will accept their C with a begrudging finality. And as the roads turn to ice and the campus dining locations close at 2 PM, you'll be on the other side of this. Together. Your friend may not be quite the same as before, but things will be okay.",

Starting at the beginning of February will be the All-American Best-Kept Squatter’s Lawn Competition. The idea is fairly simple, after close coordination with local police departments all over the country multiple squatters throughout the northern areas of the country have been located. Rather than try to go through the cumbersome, unliberal, and frankly un-American battle of forcing them out of their homes, they have been offered a chance to show how much they care about their new homes.\r\n\r\nToward the end of February, legendary garden enthusiast Joe Gardener will take a tour throughout the American North to rate and judge all of the competitors' gardens. They will be judged based on the following criteria: size, healthiness, aesthetics, and of course a baseline standard of softness; no one likes a cold and rigid plant. The winner will be given full legal ownership of the home in which they have been squatting. The losers will promptly and swiftly be disposed of.\r\n\r\nFor any neighbors worried about potentially having to permanently live next to an unsavory individual, as part of the coordination with the local police property rights for those individuals have been temporarily revoked for the duration of the competition. Essentially, squatters will receive no police aid during events of vandalism, harassment, arson threats, being in an HOA neighborhood, etc. Thus neighbors can also use this as an opportunity to help bring their local communities together too.\r\n\r\nWe hope that this competition will both help to bring people together as well as help squatters treat both their abodes and their lives better. (Note if there are no gardens able to meet the minimum score to win, all competitors will be deemed losers)",

    "body": "I was once going on a leisurely night-time stroll around campus buildings in November, which offers me the comfort of heating, and to give me the opportunity to explore buildings I otherwise don't have classes in. Doherty hall, in particular, is a complicated maze to the non-art student — and I am sure it still is even if you are one — but, I would like to shine a light on a very unique encounter I had in its lower bowels. I was gallivanting about through the hallway at its lower level, when in the corner of my eye I noticed one of the steam tunnel doors open. Coming out of it was not a maintenance personnel, but rather a traffic cone. A traffic cone with legs sticking out from under it, crawling around like Mr. Krabs. I presume this was a disguise to avoid being caught by CMUPD, as trespassing in said tunnels, while very fun and cool, is strictly forbidden. This is the dumbest fucking disguise imaginable, how could you even think that something like this is going to work? Whoever this was, they would have been better off just putting on a high-vis vest and a hard hat. You are a disgrace to your ancestors, who are much better than you at disguise; after all they have to pretend they love you. They are sobbing.",

    "title": "README Strike Thwarted By Too Many Supporters",
    "body": "The sun was shining as a group of README writers took their places along the sidewalk of Forbes Avenue. Pushing aside Jehovah’s Witnesses, the group raised their signs and began to chant: “Eshaan works us ‘till we’re dust, and he won’t fucking pay us”. Weeks of worker tensions had finally boiled over into an all-out README strike, and Carnegie Mellon’s most middlingly competent authors were taking to the streets in protest. \r\n\r\nAs the strike went on, Eshaan Joshi was seemingly unperturbed by the calls for his beheading. Sitting on his throne of solid gold README copies, he wore a crisp pinstripe suit and held a cane adorned with a bloodied pen. Upon his lap was a snow white cat which he stroked, not noticing the white fur slowly covering his lap. When asked about the strike Joshi shrugged, stating that he would “rather cut off both his arms than negotiate with those peasants.” Yet despite his confidence in the gullibility of CMU’s student body, the pitch meeting remained empty, minus a freshman who mistakenly thought it was TA office hours for Reasoning with Data. Slowly Joshi realized he would be forced to negotiate with the striking writers. “Fine,” he huffed, rising from his throne. “I’ll do it their way.”\r\n\r\nTensions were high as Joshi approached the picket line. Several demonstrators began sharpening a guillotine that had seemingly been constructed next to Walking to the Sky. “Relax” Joshi called out, “I’m not here to fire you all, I promise.” The strikers remained silent, pausing their chanting to see what their Editor-in-Chief would do next. “I’m actually here to help you guys! I’m joining the strike!” Joshi continued. “I’m all for worker rights or whatever you want.” Gasps rippled through the crowd. Several strike leaders gathered around, muttering amongst themselves and eyeing Joshi suspiciously. After careful deliberation Tali Kirschenbaum, head editor for README, carefully held out a sign for Joshi to take. Unfortunately for Kirschenbaum, she had failed to realize that there were exactly twenty-four writers on strike, and under the new CMU policy Eshaan would become the dreaded twenty-fifth demonstrator. The strike could now be classified as a disruptive political protest, and as such Carnegie Mellon had the right to crush the peaceful demonstrators using any force necessary. \r\n\r\nAs soon as Joshi picked up a sign, police clad in tactical riot gear swarmed down on the protestors from nearby bushes. The leader, holding a megaphone, commanded the students to surrender. “THIS IS AN UNLAWFUL GATHERING OF TWENTY-FIVE PEOPLE, PLACE YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD AND GET ON THE GROUND!” Before the bewildered README staff could react, canisters of tear gas were fired into the crowd. Screams could be heard all the way to Hamerschlag, and when the cloud of smoke finally lifted all twenty-four writers were bloody and bruised. Policemen lined up the protestors and blindfolded them as Joshi watched from the shadows, having slipped away in the chaos. Up in his office atop Warner Hall, Farnam Jahanian watched from the window. Officers began to raise their guns as Jahanian raised a radio to his lips. “Fire.” Shots rang out as the staff of README fell down, dead.\r\n\r\nIf you or a friend would like to join README, every single position is currently open! Please contact us today!",

Check out this list of 10 countries to try instead, which will have you studying abroad in Russia in no time!\r\n\r\n<b> 10. Ukraine </b>\r\n\r\nGive Trump and Putin a few weeks to negotiate, and you'll undoubtedly find yourself within Russian territory.\r\n\r\n<b> 9. Georgia </b>\r\n\r\nJust wait! With a little patience, you'll be part of Russia just the same.\r\n\r\n<b>8. Belarus</b>\r\n\r\nDoes linguistic genocide give you a hard-on? Much like how Western countries like France squashed their national languages in favor of one spoken by the elites, Belarus took this one step further, and made their official one of their bordering country.  \r\n\r\n<b> 7. Transnistria </b>\r\n\r\nDo you ever find yourself jacking off to USSR-era aesthetics? Are there tears running down your face mourning what once was? Yes? Then Transnistria is the perfect place for you! The flag is mostly red with a hammer and sickle in the canton, reminiscent of the vexilological layout of former SSR flags. You will find restaurants and bars decorated with soviet memorabilia everywhere you look. This country is closely aligned with Mother Russia, perfect for you!\r\n\r\n<b>6. Antarctica</b>\r\n\r\nRussia doesn't officially claim territory in Antarctica, but it's been accused of using scientific research as an excuse to exert increasing power over this chilly continent. This is a great place to study if you want to expand the motherland!\r\n\r\n<b>5. Poland</b>\r\n\r\nThey've done it before, and they'll do it again. You don't have to be a farmer at the coordinates 50.47099, 23.93432 to experience authentic Russian invasion, so long as you incite a little conflict, and don't let NATO get you down.\r\n\r\n<b>4. Finland</b>\r\n\r\nWant to have to work for your Russian study abroad? Come fight another Winter War, and make it an inside job! If Mr. Molotov's bread baskets call to you, and you never leave the sauna without your trusty Mosin-Nagant, this is the space to watch.\r\n\r\n<b>3. Serbia</b>\r\n\r\nWant to study in a country with very similar political views as Mama Rossiya, that isn’t Belarus? Serbia is a great place for you in the Balkans! Just remember, Kosovo is Serbia, do not let the majority of the world tell you otherwise.\r\n\r\n<b>2. The United States</b>\r\n\r\nLooking for a country run by an old, authoritarian man who hates the gays, and which has a history of bullying smaller countries in its sphere of influence, and makes extensive use of questionable mercenaries? You might be just where you wanted already! Check out CMIST's Washington Semester Program, or stay local and build missiles for your own jingoistic paradise!\r\n\r\n<b>1. Brighton Beach, Brooklyn</b>\r\n\r\nFor this scenic location right by the Atlantic Ocean, you won’t even have to leave the country! Looking down every street, you will see advertisements in Russian regarding injury lawyers, real estate, antique porn, and so much more! Despite being in New York, one could easily get by never having to utter a single word of English. If you ever get tired of being surrounded by 70 year-old Russian-speaking Jews, Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, Georgians, etc, simply take the Q train to Bushwick where you can take a break with a 12 dollar latte and live that gentrifier lifestyle.",

    "body": "Hey you, did you know that Carnegie Mellon University has its very own version of Superman? A larger-than life guy so essential to campus life whether social, financial, sexual, or academic? A man so powerful he can bend steel beams with his own two hands? A man who can safely operate a scissor lift? A man who can fight off great white sharks with his feet zip tied behind his back? \r\n\r\nWell, this amazing and wonderful man is none other than Farnam Jahanian (also known to students as “J-Dog”, “Big Man Jahanian”, “MC Farns”, “Farney”, among many other things). His Tuna Melt lovin’ face can be seen blessing the corners of this campus throughout the day, mainly in and around Warner Hall, his base of operations. \r\n\r\nNow, any superhero or supervillain needs a good HQ. Warner hall sits right on the corner of Forbes Avenue and the Cut, a really good vantage point for giant laser guns and buckets of hot, smouldering tar, as well as sacks of feathers – in the case of Pitt students from down the road trying to invade! This building is completely fitted out to the University President's tastes – take for example the fireman pole going from his office down to the main floor. A rather boring, money-hungry, disdainful man would not have such a thing! Neither would he stock all the coffee and tea tables in office spaces all over campus with rainbow silly straws, or commute to campus in a custom-made carriage to parade him on display through the streets of Pittsburgh playfully dubbed the ‘Farnmobile’. A student well-versed in Jahanianology could go on for hours and hours about the cool stuff Farnam has in his office (or even just stored in his pockets!), but I mean not to go just about that here, as there are so many more facets to this amazing man I also need to cover!\r\n\r\nDid you know that Farnam Jahanian is a wizard in the world of cyber security? He is an expert at analyzing complex, widely distributed cyber-attacks on IP-based networks! He is also a hero when it comes to stopping DDoS attacks before they happen, just like a Disney prince in shining armor! One time, I was in Scaife hall browsing a shop website pertaining to firearms, narcotics, and endangered species, and I happened to click on a link that said it would lead me to “hot and sexy Tartans looking to have fun near you”. Instead, unknowingly, malicious software installed itself onto my Thinkpad laptop in an attempt to use it as a stepping stone to breach the Campus network. On the other side of campus, My savior’s Farney-Sense went off,so he hit a giant red button on his desk that activates alarm sounds and red lights to turn on at Warner Hall, he slid down his flagpole to his “armory” where assistants equipped him with a kilt and bagpipes, polished his head – and on he marched to Scaife Hall. When Farnam detects a student is in trouble and is en-route to save the day, students and faculty alike stop dead in their tracks as this is a mighty sight to see! Farnam’s bald head, shiny as if it was covered in oil, will draw the attention of just about anyone here at good’ ol’ Tech, especially me when he reaches his hand out like God in “The Creation of Adam” at the tables and chairs by Red Hawk. Perhaps Farnam was the real ‘hot and sexy Tartan looking to have fun near me’ after all…\r\n\r\nNo doubt, after a couple of months here at Carnegie Mellon, every student and faculty member will have a tale such as this one of their own to tell. It is unheard of to never have such a run in with the man. While it is not typically advertised in campus publications, websites, or tours, it is no doubt that Farnam Jahanian is the glue that holds this one big Tartan family together. His blood builds the campus, his tears water our lawns, his laughter fills our stages and auditoriums, and the sun reflecting off his head gives us light.",

    "body": "The Penn of Western Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, is known globally as a hub of innovation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and so much more. Not only are these hardworking students known for their level of involvement in undergraduate and graduate research, but they have also been trailblazers in the field of collegiate tradition generation. Buggy racing, a sport originating from gilded-age fraternity brothers drunkenly racing each other down hills in buggies (Western Pennsylvania English for “shopping cart”), is probably the most well known tradition originating from this campus. However, there are many more that aren’t as well known: Painting the fence, “Gazorching,” Inverse Bungee Jumping, Carnival, just to name a few. However, I would like to bring to light one peculiarly delightful tradition known ominously as “The Hunt”. This tradition involves participants stripping entirely naked at the dead of night, and slathering themselves head-to-toe with peanut butter. Participants then hide all over campus, trying to evade a pack of starving Scottish Terriers looking for their first meal in over a month.\r\n\r\nFollowing is one account by a local student who participated in the year 2024, –\r\n\r\n“In my first year here at CMU during carnival, I saw a flyer for “the Hunt” somewhere on campus – and there was a QR code you could scan to sign up. It said it was pretty competitive because everyone wants to do it, and it could only take up to 30 students. I managed to make it in because I wrote some really good essay questions on why I wanted to participate. I remember we all lined up at 2 am outside Hunt Library – which is named after the Hunt actually – and then we heard the dogs barking. It got increasingly louder as the U-Haul trucks came closer carrying the dogs. Farnam himself stood with a large tub of peanut butter and he was slathering the students himself. We all stood shoulder-to-shoulder in front of Hunt and then the starter pistol fired and we all ran. We were told we had two minutes until when the dogs would be released, but it felt like a lot less. I had planned and practiced a little bit, and my strategy was to run to Highmark, because the dogs would not recognize the new building. Unfortunately I had dripped some peanut butter on the way there, and I actually heard a dog badging into highmark. I heard it get closer and closer and I heard some sniffing at the keyhole of the door I was hiding behind – fortunately, I heard a loud noise outside, and then the dog started running, and I heard a student screaming outside. I took the opportunity to run into the maintenance penthouse and onto the roof, where I waited it out until sunrise, which is when the game ends. As a prize, I got a free raspberry pi 4.”\r\n\r\nBlood sports like this typically aren’t allowed on college campuses, but here at Carnegie Mellon, not only is it encouraged, but the president himself slathers you in the peanut butter.",

And CMU – the unique, insane school it is – has turned their plot completely on its head.\r\n\r\nTexas Instruments professed just one reason for their calculators to completely stop their modification. TI calculators have long had a dedicated, passionate fanbase of programmers and hackers, modding and sharing detailed games and elaborate projects the world over. And TI hates them. Despises them. In a recent  press release, representatives of the corporation — bombarded with incensed outcries and comparisons to the Desmos software’s community scene — said a total of eleven words before having to leave the room to calm down. On the personal and corporate level, TI wants its hackers gone.. \r\n\r\nWe should have seen TI’s more drastic measures coming a long, long time ago. True fans of the company recognize, or even remember if particularly lucky, their work on the elaborate BOLT-117 laser-guided missile. Widely regarded as a gorgeous piece of engineering, TI opened the industry of building hyper-capable electronics into massive dumb bombs. If only they had a modern product of hyper-capable electronics to stuff with dumb bombs.\r\n\r\nUnder this proud banner was the TI-C4 released. Identical to a TI-84 Plus CE – if one ignores its seven-segment countdown panel and several extra pounds – it has become TI’s new flagship product overnight. Nothing better represents their modern poison-dart-frog-esque sentiment: if you don’t mess with the calculator in any capacity, the calculator will not disassemble your anatomy to any degree.\r\n\r\nCMU students have taken up the challenge. We’ve reached out to a newborn student organization at CMU – lovingly named We Don’t Blow **** Up Committee — to see what CMU is doing about the latest threat to students having a good time. Founded last Tuesday by two CMU Esports Platinum CS:GO players who earned “Most Enthusiastic Counter-Terrorist” several years running, WDB*UC has burgeoned overnight into a training camp for amateur bomb defusal specialists. They’ve bulk ordered hundreds of TI-C4s, enduring countless cease-and-desists from the mailing room, to fund their operation; and shared why they turned their passions towards these new products.\r\n\r\n“Well, firstly, spite,” said one. “Good and pure rage. Everyone’s now got a bone to pick with TI over them being little cowards. Surely one of them is a cybersecurity guy, and we can share if not.” \r\n\r\n“And on a more serious note,” answered the other, “they’re a perfect dual playing ground. You can work from afar, breaking in through software and trying not to trigger the automatic anti-modification detectors, or you can go in by hand and work on the electronics up close. We’ve never been able to get this many CS and ECE students in a room without critical mass burning down the school. Things are looking good for us.”\r\n\r\nThe WDB*UC is indeed seeing wide, wide success. It’s attracted CMU’s elusive drama and creative writing students as rapt spectators to the tense defusing rooms. It’s provided free bombless calculators to two high schools in the Pittsburgh area, and free calculatorless bombs to other unnamed grateful parties. And it’s witnessed yet another TI executive tragically pass away from a stress aneurysm — whether simple coincidence, or a successful push against injustice, I’m not at license to say.",

    "body": "Recently, a mixup occurred on CMU's campus at a recruiting event for the Transportation Security Administration, the agency responsible for securing air travel to, from, and within the United States. The event was booked for the Danforth Lounge, for 6 PM on Sunday. But in the neighboring Danforth Conference Room, another TSA was setting up for a GBM: CMU's own Taiwanese Students Association.\r\n\r\nDue to the ensuing confusion, the entirety of the bodies of the two organizations were swapped overnight. Pittsburgh's hotels are swamped as over 60,000 former airport security officers are celebrating Taiwanese heritage, while the nation's airports are in chaos as around 100 East Asian CMU students attempt to operate the security infrastructure spread across the US's 480 international airports.\r\n\r\nWe talked to one exhausted former CMU student at Baltimore/Washington International Airport, who was attempting to scan the luggage of over one thousand passengers per hour. \"I'm supposed to be responsible for Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC,\" she said. \"I've been alternating between them every hour, but many flights are still being missed.\"\r\n\r\nOther airport security agents have simply given up. \"I just watched a full passenger plane blow up thirty seconds after takeoff,\" the former president of the Taiwanese Students Association told us. \"I saw bodies fall from the sky.\"\r\n\r\nBack at CMU, every lecture hall is filled to capacity as former security officials educate themselves on Taiwan and its rich cultural history. Many are former veterans. \"I feel slightly out of place on a college campus,\" one said. \"I haven't patted down someone's crotch in weeks.\"\r\n\r\nMany on both sides of the mixup hope it will be resolved shortly. \"We keep trying to reserve the two Danforths on 25Live in the opposite direction, but they keep denying our reservations,\" says one student. Some have appealed to CMU's registrars directly, but received no reply from the administrators, who are swamped by paperwork from the tens of thousands of new students.",

In a shocking wave of terrible news, however, numerous upperclassmen have been found dead near the former UHS entrance, piled up like the lanternflies near Walking to the Sky. “I had a really bad cold, so I wanted to come to UHS and get some cough drops,” said one deceased senior. “But when I discovered that UHS wasn’t at E-Tower anymore, I figured it wasn’t worth trying to find the new spot, so I just decided I wouldn’t even bother living anymore.” “Mine wasn’t even that bad,” said another, “I just needed an excuse to get out of here.” A number of other dead bodies echoed the sentiment, making it well known to all around that they were just done with this shit.",

    "body": "Readme is proud to announce that it will be hosting a party this Friday night to welcome all incoming freshmen present for o-week, and yes, there will be alcohol. To be invited, simply bring a copy of this week’s Readme issue with you and show it to our bouncer. “What about IDs? Won’t we need to show you our IDs? I went through the trouble of making fake IDs in preparation for college life all for nothing?”, my overactive imagination envisions you, the reader, thinking. Obviously, we won't serve alcohol to partygoers if we see their IDs stating that they are underage.\r\nBefore giving more details about the party, I, as one of the writers at Readme, would like to reaffirm Readme’s core values and commitment to maintaining those values and high standards of conduct among our staff. Readme is dedicated to providing the facts, and only the facts, to the diverse student body of Carnegie Mellon University. We also pride ourselves on providing an example of how students ought to behave, not just as University students, but as moral, well-functioning adults, so readers may strive to become productive members of society. It is for all these reasons that Readme will continue to adhere strictly to the just laws of this great nation and state. The federal minimum drinking age in the US is 21; just as in past parties, if we see the IDs of anyone at the drinks table that states that they are under 21, we will peacefully (then forcefully if required) turn the student away from the drinks table, and remove them from the party altogether. To prevent this student from re-attempting to drink despite being underage, we will also forward the student’s name along with a picture of their photo ID to other student organizations whom we keep contact with, in case the student tries to drink at any of those organizations’ parties.\r\nWith all this being said, Readme would like to announce our updated ID policy for this Friday’s party: we will not ask to look at your ID. It’s quite simple, see: if we do not see that your ID states that you are under 21, we won’t know that you are underage and therefore have no obligation to prevent you from drinking. In fact, if you for whatever reason as an underage person decide to shove your ID into the face of our bouncers so we are forced to look at your IDs, we will simply pretend to be extremely nearsighted or illiterate.\r\nWe look forward to all the students who will show up for a night of decadence and debauchery. Happy drinking",

However, leading scientists recently discovered a positive relationship between childhood immunization and readiness for Carnegie Mellon University.    \r\n\r\nSCS freshman Lily Anderson received the measles-mumps rubella vaccine at age three. By age four, her parents had already begun to notice the markings of a gifted child. According to Anderson’s mother, Sheila, “Lily would sit there for hours solving algebraic equations. If a kid asked to play with her, she’d cover her ears and drown out the sound of their voice until they walked away. I think the vaccine made her more committed to academics.”    \r\n\r\nAs Anderson got older, her dedication to learning didn’t wane at all, nor did her ability to resist distractions. Anderson’s father Greg described her unwillingness to party, stating, “Lily never went to those big ragers in high school. She preferred to spend her time in the quiet, dimly lit cocoon of her own bedroom. That level of focus is what Carnegie Mellon looks for.”    \r\n\r\nWhen contacted by ReadME, Anderson herself declined to offer comment, stating that she was too busy reading the Wikipedia page for 19th-century textile mills.",

The glass on the building all shattered, and because CMU has no money, they elected to cover the glass with cardboard and bedsheets. Business students have set up a bakery sale to help fund the reconstruction of the building. The culprit was not caught but witnesses described the student as “definitely David Tepper himself and not a student at all”. Please contact README with any additional information. \r\n\r\nEngines of Cars Stolen, Turned into Strange Statue \r\nEngines from cars parked on Beeler and Margaret Morrison Streets were unexpectedly stolen and replaced with fake bombs, causing panic and an overwhelming spike in calls to the CMUPD. When checking out where the engines could have gone, they discovered a statue made of melted engines in the shape of a toilet in Merson Courtyard. A printed note was left on top of the toilet in a mix of Russian and Esperanto but authorities were too confused to translate it. The car owners were not given any compensation for their lost engines.  \r\n\r\nStray Cats Cause Ruckus In Underground \r\nAfter a rat was set loose, causing multiple fires, in the Underground by an unidentified student, another unidentified student brought several stray cats to deal with the aftermath of the fire. The cats however, seemed to have other plans and proceeded to sell anything salvageable for three times their value on Depop and rent the place out to their other cat friends for an ungodly amount for the condition. When the cats were captured, they told the local reporter “Mraow'', which can only mean they would have done more. They will be held at the local animal shelter to pay for their crimes and all their money gained was confiscated. \r\n\r\nMagazine Editor Commits Various OSHA Violations \r\nA local satire magazine editor was recently handed several Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) violations due to unsafe workplace practices. Said editor forced staff to handle construction and heavy machinery without any training, fall protection or adequate equipment.  Employees also handled hazardous chemicals without being informed they were actually hazardous. When the employees were asked about their thoughts on the situation one replied, “I did think it was strange when my arm started to glow neon purple.” It should be noted none of the employees questioned why a satire magazine needed to build or handle chemicals in the first place. Currently, the editor is trying to sue OSHA for “wrongful violations” and “being bad at their job”.",

Large scuff marks leading to Fairfax have been found by students. The installation depicted the multiple paint layers on the Fence from 1993 to 2023. CMUPD and CMU administration are unsure of how the sculpture could have been stolen. Witnesses from the night of the attack deny ever seeing a suspicious person(s) near the sculpture. Students residing in Forbes Beeler did not notice or seem particularly upset over the loss of the statue. Currently, there are no leads. CMUPD is currently looking for any DNA evidence left behind that could point to a suspect. \r\n\r\n<b>Unknown Printer Menace Still At Large </b>\r\n\r\nIn a scheme to make everyone suffer, someone has tampered with all the public printers on campus. All the printers were paper jammed or had no paper. On top of that, many of the printers had no toner. Students are frantically urging the university to put a stop to this madness, however there is no evidence that the printers were maliciously interfered with. Custodial staff and faculty have reported that there was no unusual behavior near the printers. One professor commented that he saw a student trying to print a hundred page reading single-sided, but nothing about a potential printer menace. Still, much of the student body is convinced that the printers are being tampered with. The university has urged students to contact the support person for whatever printer they are using if issues arise.  \r\n\r\n<b>3D Printer Almost Burns Dorm Down </b>\r\n\r\nIn one of CMU’s freshman dormitories, a 3D printer overheated and triggered the fire alarm. The student was trying to 3D print a life size model of the Statue of Liberty, and left their 3D printer running recklessly for weeks using ABS plastic. Thankfully, no fire actually occurred due to the sprinkler system. When the RA responsible went to investigate, the student’s prohibited electronic devices were discovered. The student was then forced to ship their 3D printer and coffee pot home. Currently no further action is being pursued against said student, who will stay anonymous.",

CMU is a prison, and the only thing anyone cares about is how tough you seem. Second, always remember you go to a private school. It's hard being that much better than everyone else. Do not let people forget that. Third, remember these CMU rules:\r\n\r\n1) It's not underage drinking if you've aged from stress. I'm basically 35 at this point\r\n\r\n2) Never invest in your roommate's startup. Those only work out at Stanford\r\n\r\n3) Party hard, live fast. Run from the cops faster.\r\n\r\nWe here at readme are ecstatic that you've decided you've decided to come to CMU, of all places. Because now you're stuck here. There is no escape. Your attempts to 'have fun' will be overwritten by 60 FCE semesters that are required to graduate on time. Your dreams of partying and getting drunk will be relegated to a sad, lonely, \"what's the move\" text sent at 10:35 in your floor gc. Your weekend plans will get ruined because some sicko assigned the homework to be due at 8 P.M. on a Saturday. And when you, sobbing to yourself, try to find a transfer application for somewhere, anywhere else, you'll sit there, staring at a buffering screen, because when CMU boasts that it had the 'first campus wide Wi-Fi network', that's because that's the tech they're still using.\r\n\r\nWe're not trying to scare you off. We're sure you'll have a great time here. It's a four year experience that lasts between four-and-a-half and five, statistically. So lock in, buckle up, get ready for your one (1) life-changing college experience, and with a warm welcome to the place we love...",

Unless, of course, you buy the all inclusive package for 20% more plus shipping, in which case you can enjoy Carnegie Mellon from the comfort of your own home, 24/7, on up to three different devices! This place has a long and storied history, as one of the first institutions of higher learning on this side of the Appalachians. From the Fence, first constructed in 1917 to keep students from jumping into The Ravine, to the secret tunnels under Purnell that drama professors use to escape angry mobs, to the pre­finals scream all students participate in to convince their professors to curve, dear ol' Tech is a place with a good many traditions for you to engage in. And besides studying in Hunt, and studying in Sorrells, and studying in your dorm, and studying in bed, there is actually quite a bit to do here. I haven't even touched on all the good study rooms in the UC.\r\n\r\n\r\nReadme, of course, is excited to see you all here, and we really do wish the best in your time on this campus. While we do not, in any way, endorse fun, it's important to remember to prank all your professors once a semester ­ it's hard to get an A otherwise. CMU's a wonderful place, filled with wonderful people, and you'll make your government­mandated one (1) lifelong memory here in due time. The rest of it? Honestly pretty forgettable.\r\nWith all that aside, it's good to remember the three rules of college:\r\n\r\n\r\n 1) Don't increase the population\r\n\r\n 2) Don't decrease the population\r\n\r\n 3) Try not getting caught?\r\n\r\nWithout further ado, and with a warm welcome to hell itself...\r\n\r\n\r\n# *readme, volume #2, issue #0*",

    "title": "So you're on a couple waitlists",
    "body": "This past week CMU students were given the opportunity to register for spring semester classes. Due to over-enrollment this year some poor sops (me) were given 9:30 pm registration times. By noon, 15-122 already had a 370-person waitlist, which is fine, it’s only a pre-req to every single course I need. Despair set in as students with unfortunate registration times (me) panicked about getting graduation requirements. However, there need not be panic. There are many benefits to being on the waitlist, but it's fine as it is.\r\n\r\nFirst, if you’re stressing about taking concepts and 15-122 in the same semester, or planning on registering for whatever weedout course your major requires, don’t worry, you won’t have to do these hard courses because you can’t get in. You can spend this new found free time making fun of your friends that have to take hard courses (absolute suckers). You don’t even have to take easy core courses at 8:00 am because the people with 3:00 pm registration times took them. If you were planning on doing a double major, that burden is lifted off of your shoulders because no way are you ever getting off of the waitlist for any of the courses you need for that second major.\r\n\r\nSecond, as finals week rapidly approaches, there is no solace in the fact that we have to do this all again in the spring. However, there’s nothing to worry about! Only being registered for one course means just the one final. I get to spend the last half of finals week laughing at you nerds. Bonus: if you just drop out you never have to take finals again, and then other people (me) can get off of waitlists.\r\nThird, you can finally achieve a healthy sleep schedule. CMU students are known to spend 80-plus hours a week doing schoolwork. If you couldn’t get the courses you need next semester, fear not, you will have plenty of time to fix your ruined sleep schedule. You can finally go to sleep before 3:00 am. No more late night trips to Scotties to buy a caseload of Celisus for your third all-nighter in a row. You can sleep soundly with the anxiety of getting employed at [insert quant firm here] without taking 15-210.\r\nFourth, you can finally call your mom, with no courses to occupy your schedule you definitely have time to call her. I know you're addicted to your phone, so use it to call her. Why are you still reading this? Go call your mother, she misses you. It’s not like you're going to get off the waitlist in the 30 minutes you spend talking to her.",

A Pitt alumn elaborated in an interview, “I always loved studying up there. The fear of death that comes from doing multidimensional calculus at that height—gusts of wind blowing your notes around, the ledge so perilously close to your study nook, pset deadline three minutes away and ticking down fast—it was really just an immense boost to my productivity. I haven’t been able to focus so well since I was an undergrad. But now I can visit my alma mater, finally get some work done, and zap some pretentious CMU students all in the same visit? I wouldn’t pass it up for the world.”\r\n\r\nLuckily for us, a recent email from the War Director at CMU states that Carnegie Mellon’s new Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics, replacing the now-demolished Skibo Gym, is on schedule to provide necessary shelter in the form of yet another turtle on campus. \r\n\r\n{{gates_turtle.png}}\r\n\r\nAs we all know, turtles have hard shells on their backs. Additionally, arbitrary cross sections of turtles' shells are smooth concave surfaces, and as such are suitable for deflecting lasers (see helpful graphic).

    "title": "Novel Methods of Preventing Wasteful Elevator Use at CMU",
    "body": "{{elevatordrawing.png}}\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nWhen John Elevator first unveiled elevators at the Chicago World Fair in Des Moines IA, 1462, the technology immediately garnered worldwide adoption. Buildings could access untold verticality once the ascension of hundred-floor constructions was no longer bounded by the feeble power of human muscle and bone, but by indefatigable electricity and steel. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, at our own Carnegie Mellon University, residents have bought in so heavily to indefatigable electricity and steel that 98% of all elevator use on campus is used to traverse a single floor (Et Al and others, 2021). This causes wasteful energy consumption—as expensive as maintaining the Orientation Tent when compared by the day on non-summer school days (Et Al and the other others, 2020)—and aggravated foot-tapping of the 58% of people taking the elevator from Wean 4 to Wean 8 who somehow end up stopping on every intermediate floor (Et Al et al., 2018). As a correlational effect, students are noticed to be starved of exercise (Etward Alabama, 2019). But most importantly of all, the stairs are quite sad (Ed Allen, 2012).\r\n\r\nWe have developed a new methodology that is projected to influence these metrics positively by orders of magnitude. After describing our methods and their tested benefits, we will discuss potential counterarguments regarding this procedure.\r\n\r\n### Methods and Results\r\nThis study introduces a new type of elevator, currently installed in Wean. When a user inputs a commute of one floor, a secret door opens opposite the main elevator entrance. Thwarted in their attempts to circumvent exercise, and presented with a quick, easy, and free alternative, we found that after a trial period of one week, 87% of users faced with the open stairwell opted to use it for their one-floor trip instead of waiting for the elevator to slowly close and proceed to the rest of its destination queue. We find it interesting to mention that a large majority of the remaining users took the elevator up two floors, then took the stairs down: a less effortful endeavor compared to ascending outright, at the cost of time.\r\n\r\nOverall, we have found a 500% increase in stair usage, a major success, and will likely reproduce our experiment in elevators campus-wide in future work.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nWe conclude with some common perceived pain points we received during user interviews.\r\n\r\n“Why do this? Just add one more lane, one more lane will fix traffic flow this time.”\r\n\r\nWhile, at the surface level, a traffic clog in the Wean staircase between classes may seem to cause students to use the elevator as an alternative, we found that this was not the case. Students who use the stairs for one route practically always use the stairs, even during traffic congestion; similar patterns are true for elevator users. Maybe you would find some better luck applying this idea to our highway system.\r\n\r\n“You still use O(n) energy.”\r\nWhat does this even mean? You should always define n, unless the term’s meaning is heavily implied (and even then, if you’re completing your latest 15122 written). Are you saying that we have exchanged one energy expense per one-floor elevator travel and opening for one energy expense per secret passageway opening? In that case, remember that in the real world, constant factors do matter; the power used to open doors close doors, increment a floor, open doors, and close doors is much more than simply opening and closing a set of doors.\r\n\r\n“I use a wheelchair, suffer from a mobility impairment, am carrying a heavy object, etc.”\r\n\r\nJust take the elevators up three floors and down two. There’s a small enough minority of you all that you can use the elevators in a more expensive way while not impacting the overall energy use significantly. Call that amortization, or something.",

    "title": "Wean is Shabbat Friendly?",
    "body": "On Shabbat, Jews are not to parttake in physical activity, work, or use contraptions that use electricity voluntarily – which means one cannot press the buttons of an elevator. Many institutions use what are known as “shabbat elevators”, which are elevators that stop and open at every floor, such that observant jews could go onto a different floor while still obeying G-d. One example of such an institution that uses this technology is Wean Hall at Carnegie Mellon University, a prestigious T5 tech school nestled in the foothills of the Allegheny Mountains. The way these elevators are shabbat compliant is rather unique – rather than using code that activates on a Friday evening sunset to enable Shabbat mode, the University provides a multitude of goyish students to enter and exit at each floor. If one were to, lets say, try to traverse from floor 4 to 7, a very common commute here, the following scene would play out: someone calls the elevator at floor 4, as is common, and presses the button for floor 5 because they are a lazy fuck that cannot bother to use the stairs. Once you are on the elevator and it gets to floor 5, this loser exits and a different schmuck enters and presses the button for floor 6. Once there, the same scene plays out. If an observant Jew were to be on this elevator, Hashem would be very pleased. However, this method of using human labor to turn elevators into Shabbat machines has a major oversight – hoards of lazy people usually aren’t on floors 1, 2, 3, 8, or 9, which means that a nice jewish boy, girl, or neither would have to press the buttons themselves on these levels. Hopefully, the university supplies incentives to increase the student population at these floors, or just catches up to the rest of the world on Shabbat elevator technology.",

In this case, our loyal reporters have followed the crumb trail to a pair of menaces doing suspicious activity around campus for the past weeks. \r\n\r\n**Camper Crushers Take to Unicycles**\r\n\r\nTwo bears have recently joined the CMU Unicycle Appreciation Association. These bears have been seen on campus for a few weeks, disguised in hats, scarves, t-shirts, shorts and tutus. Their reason for being on campus is unknown, however they have been seen riding their unicycles all across campus and greater Pittsburgh, perhaps in an attempt to cover up their easily identifiable bear paws. Most likely, these bears are on the run from animal control and park rangers for their crimes against campers. The authorities have been contacted but they informed reaDmE that the bears were “Nothing to worry about”. \r\n\r\n**Sniffing For Meat Amongst Student Body**\r\n\r\nThe bears have been seen handing out jars of salmon jerky and overnight oats for free at the UC, despite not being part of any student organization. While our reporters weren’t able to obtain any before stock ran out, we were able to find some residue leftover in a trashcan. Some of the residue was contaminated with other trash but a sample was obtained nonetheless for testing.  Upon examining the remains, one reporter threw up immediately, a clear sign of poison. These bears are obviously trying to poison the study body to harvest their bodies for meat. \r\n\r\n**Deadly Pair Create Disguises for Escape**\r\n\r\nThese two have also been found knitting fuzzy sweaters, hats, gloves, and so forth outside of Wean. Animal Control and park rangers must have pinned the bears for crimes against humanity and as such, the pair are making new human disguises. One reporter bravely went up to investigate and didn't return for several hours. He was later found sleeping in Sorrells Library in a very large and comfortable sweater with a mug of hot cocoa next to him. We can only conclude that he was knocked out deliberately by the bears who are now onto us. Unfortunately, it seems the bears have made off with their disguises and are now on the run somewhere else. If any readers have any information about the bear situation contact readME immediately!",

    "body": "The Big Apple. The City of Angels. The Motor City. The Windy City. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is known by many names that reflect the splendor and enigma of this Pacific Northwest paradise.  \r\n\r\nA European jewel nestled in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains, Pittsburgh has amazed at least a dozen CMU students — strangers to the excesses of Sin City. \r\n\r\n“I’m from New York City where there's only a grassy field, two cows, and a gay club called ‘Club Diesel’,” commented one CMU student, “so seeing the towering skyscrapers of Pittsburgh was really different.”\r\nA second new student continued, “I’ve lived my whole life in the vibrant metropolis of Mossville, Illinois. It’s really fast-paced and densely packed and the only visible wildlife is pigeons. The giant sand dunes and rolling hills of Pittsburgh were definitely a new experience.”\r\n\r\n“I’m from a city with a lot of bridges,” a third student added, “so finding out about the total lack of bridges in Pittsburgh was a real shock.”\r\n\r\nPittsburgh, more commonly referred to as the City of the Violet Crown, is known globally for its myriad of natural landmarks. In particular, Pittsburgh is famous for its three converging rivers: the Colorado River, the Ganges, and the Euphrates. Further, Pittsburgh landmarks such as the Colosseum, the Gateway Arch, and Gary-the-Rock-with-googly-eyes attract millions of visitors annually.\r\nFor residents, Pittsburgh is known for its robust public transit, with maglev bullet trains, thirty person clown cars, and those dumbass electric scooters being the most common transportation methods. While travelling, residents report frequent sightings of kangaroos alongside rare sightings of the hellbender salamander. One person even reported seeing a squirrel.\r\n\r\nArts. Culture. Arts and culture. Culture and arts. Food. Pittsburgh cuisine is famous for the key lime pie reuben, an abomination enjoyed by Pittsburgh captains of industry since the Industrial Revolution. Since then, Pittsburgh industry has been dominated by the production of onions and onions alone. A bright eyed upstart once suggested producing shallots, and was promptly laughed out of the city.\r\nLastly, Pittsburgh is known for its normal colleges, normal college students, and normal satire publications. One of those normal satire publications, ReadMe, a local gem and majority shareholder of Pittsburgh's third most prominent saloon, would like to say from the bottom of its normal satire publication heart: Welcome to Pittsburgh, the City of Brotherly Love.",

    "body": "To most of us, \"MIT\" stands for one thing, and one thing only: an overused BSD-style software license. But in a suburb of Boston, a little-known private university known as Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been racking up accolades at an impressive rate, sparking curiosity among CMU students and faculty.\r\n\r\nThe gist of MIT is pretty simple: it's basically a smaller, shittier CMU. With an undergraduate population of 4500 and a graduate population of 7300, it hasn't quite caught up to our Carnegie Tech, which boasts 7700 undergrads and 8600 graduate students. While CMU's historic campus spans a range of architectural styles, it's anchored by the seven original beaux-arts style buildings, from the turn of the 20th century. MIT, in contrast, started with a disorganized jumble of buildings, which only worsened as changing architectural style gripped the campus in its maw, violently flinging it between brutalist abstraction and postmodernist disorder, never managing to snap its neck cleanly.\r\n\r\nCMU may claim the spot as #1 in computer science, but MIT is a close tie for second. What MIT truly lacks, as its name may suggest, is the breadth that makes CMU stand out. Carnegie Mellon boasts world-class drama, architecture, and business programs, in addition to the STEM majors it's most famous for. It fearlessly pushes the boundaries of multidisciplinary collaboration, single-handedly introducing academic disciplines ranging from artificial intelligence to decision science. MIT may as well be stuck in a previous century.\r\n\r\nUnlike CMU, some say going to MIT can be a significant source of stress. Its official motto, \"I Hate This Fucking Place\", is proudly displayed on its class rings. A common hobby at MIT is \"shafting\", which may describe either the practice of climbing through walls to access secret tunnels, or paying the cost of its tuition. MIT is close neighbors with Harvard, a decrepit business school with which it shares a cross-registration program.\r\n\r\nDespite its many shortcomings, MIT is all over the news. Always on the lookout for an underdog, journalists are quick to point out the cutting-edge research which sometimes occurs. Keep an eye on this rising star in the coming years!",

CMU’s changed a lot since you’ve graduated, but don’t fear: readMe is here to get you up to speed.\r\n\r\n<b>Schatz has acquired its first Michelin star. </b>\r\n\r\nThe premiere dining experience on CMU’s campus is Schatz dining hall. We recommend alumni enjoy a delightful supper. However, be aware that the dress code is strictly enforced, and anything less than a suit will get you evicted from the premises. They didn’t pay for 2nd-floor window access for nothing.\r\n\r\n<b>Entropy has reasonably priced items. </b>\r\n\r\nFollowing popular demand Entropy has re-evaluated its pricing scheme. The cost of a bag of chips has gone from 1 kidney to $13.99.\r\n\r\n<b>Walking to the sky has been extended by 1 foot. </b>\r\n\r\nWe don’t really know why they did this one. Make sure to remind current students that when you were here walking to the sky was a foot shorter. But only ‘about’, because you’re mostly sure, and it used to seem a little taller anyway back before Gates was installed or whatever.\r\n\r\n<b>15-122 is now an easy light hearted class. </b>\r\n\r\nCurrent students don’t know the pain they could have suffered. Make sure to point out that when you were here it was a real class and this generation doesn’t know how good they have it. You had to walk to check-ins uphill both ways, after all.\r\n\r\n<b>CMU Football is all the rage. </b>\r\n\r\nStudents have finally recognized the talent of our football players. There are rumors of plans for a new, larger football stadium in the works.\r\n\r\n<b>Unfortunately Donner is still here. </b>\r\n\r\nIf there's one thing that will never change about CMU, it's the empty promise that Donner will be torn down.

    "title": "Winning the War on Christmas",
    "body": "{{santaMenorah.png}}\r\n\r\nAs we all know, Christmas is falling out of favor with the American public. “Merry Christmas” has been replaced with “Happy holidays.” Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts have replaced their Christmas-themed special cups and boxes with holiday-nonspecific red and green cups and boxes printed with tinsel patterns. Christmas movies are about 8-year-olds outwitting criminals invading their family’s homes and policemen thwarting terrorist operations rather than finding the true meaning of Christmas. The thought of it makes me shudder. With that in mind, the Jewish writers of reADMe have decided to join the War on Christmas—on the side of Christmas. With that, here are some ways that we, the true saviors of Christmas, will win.\r\n\r\n**Celebrate it for eight days.**\r\n\r\nWe all know that one day of Christmas is way too short. However, twelve days of Christmas is just too much of a commitment for most people. I propose we meet in the middle, with eight. Why eight, you ask, when half of twelve is six? Well, six just sucks as a number, and five and seven are both odd, which is bad. This means that eight is the best number of days for a holiday as special and important as Christmas to be.\r\n\r\n**Light candles instead of a tree.**\r\n\r\nChristmas trees are a hassle for most families. In recent years, many have resorted to buying fake trees, or decorating other items that can sit in a corner or window. Instead of buying expensive trees and ornaments every year, buy a much cheaper singular item that fits eight candles (one for each day) and 44 very thin candles (so as to light two on the first day, three on the second, and so on and so forth, as one candle lights all the others). This will save money in the long run, and an enormous amount of time and effort spent preparing the tree.\r\n\r\n**Eat oily, fried foods.**\r\n\r\nThe fact that I, as a Jewish person, don’t know whether Christmas has any foods strongly associated with it really exemplifies why Christmas is losing the War on Christmas. So what better than eating foods fried in oil? What’s more American than donuts, maybe even filled with jelly? What’s more Christian than shredding a potato and frying it in oil to make a sort of pancake? If nothing else will save Christmas, Big Cooking Oil will.\r\n\r\n**Gamble.**\r\n\r\nAmericans are addicted to gambling. So addicted, in fact, that it is incredibly sensible to celebrate Christmas by betting real or chocolate money on a game of near-complete chance. By spinning a top akin to a four-sided die, with the sides decorated to commemorate the miracle of the birth of Jesus Christ, Christmas celebrations can be made fun again by playing over chocolate coins, or contentious by betting real ones. These tops can be wooden or plastic, but are most special if you make them out of clay.",

A new policy has just entered into testing by the lab of Dr. Et Al, and has shown remarkable results in regards to student-professor relations. \r\n\r\nThis policy grants students the ability to assign an unrestricted amount of work to any professor at CMU, or in the state of Pennsylvania. This levels out the playing field by ensuring that professors can relate directly to the everyday struggle of students as they engage in the unending slog of CMU coursework. This practice will ensure that the bond between students and their instructors is tighter than previously seen, and as a labor history professor put it, “we are united in toil.”\r\n\r\n“Since the policy has entered into testing, I've assigned four different professors a compendium of League Of Legends Mechanics and Strategy guides. For the final this weekend we will be queuing as a 5-stack” \r\nRyan Chernoff, a School of Computer Science student at 5124 Margaret Morrison St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 who asked to remain “anonymous”, but to that we respond, “hi anonymous i’m dad”\r\n\r\n“It is so nice to be the one producing mediocre work instead of lazily skimming over students' work and rolling a 5d20 to determine their grade—as I have been doing for the past 17 years.”\r\nA CMU professor who works at CMU who asked for their CMU affiliation with CMU to remain anonymous\r\n\r\n“Fuck th*s shit, this is why I want to do research only.”\r\nDr. Et Al, the professor who is leading this very study",

I had the opportunity to taste a unique and rare brain a few years ago, and had I known whose it was, I would have eaten the whole thing- what good that would have done for the world.\r\nAt first, I thought the brain of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself, well-known American politician, influencer, and current US Secretary of Health and Human Services would be a lovely, hearty meal- this guy’s an environmentalist, a lawyer, fights for minority rights, and is the nephew of John F. Kennedy? What more could you ask for? \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I found the experience quite unpleasant. First, the brain didn’t even taste good! The prefrontal cortex had this weird aftertaste, which was probably due to all the lying he does. The frontal lobe was disgusting. It tasted somewhat like bear meat, strangely. The whole thing was fishy– Kennedy eats a lot of tuna, and I think I have mercury poisoning too now. \r\n\r\nThere wasn’t even that much brain to eat. It’s all just vaccine denial, “Make America Healthy Again,” and conspiracy theories—where did all the good stuff go? There was no room to be picky. Then, just as I was getting settled in, Kennedy tweets “I offer to eat 5 more brain worms and still beat President Trump and President Biden in a debate. I feel confident in the result even with a six-worm handicap.” The absolute nerve of this man to be offering this already meager meal to five other worms! I worked very hard to get to my position of Chief Food Reviewer at this newspaper, and I’m not giving it up to some upstarts who were practically invited in! No, if you want this brain, you have to earn it- you have to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and find your own undercooked pork. \r\n\r\nAnd on top of all of that, this guy has the gall to bring me up during his divorce proceedings! Because apparently I “lower his earning potential” or something. He claims I caused “memory loss and mental fog.” I say I was just surviving. A worm has got to eat.",

    "body": "From the enclosure movement in 18th century England, the owning class has been tasked with answering how to maximize the productivity of their peons. As the modern American university becomes increasingly corporate and a profit-seeking endeavor, similar questions are now being asked by university administrators. Many things have been tried in the past- lashings, paternalistic brainwashing, foremen - which are certainly things university administrators should try, but may not be the most effective. This project found that the answer lies in the Yerkes-Dodson law, not external disincentives. The Yerkes Dodson law is a psychological theory stating that humans are most productive at their given “optimal arousal state” - i.e. a mental state somewhere between underwhelmed and overwhelmed. By shifting this state rightwards, students will be able to undertake more stress and therefore be more productive than they currently are under present CMU workloads. While this study did not manage to discover a method for causing this rightward shift, we identify the need for such by comparing the effectiveness of other productivity-increasing methods in past literature.",
