Under heavy fire from ed, students were ordered not to stress and to get sleep before the examination, however many found these to be impossible feats. \r\n\r\nThe scene was thus: exhausted students, desperately writing lines by hand, because although technology has progressed to the point that we currently have text generating large language models and at least partially functioning virtual reality headsets, the Carnegie Mellon University (home of AI) Intro to Programming course’s midterm is still on paper. Godspeed if you don’t have an eraser, or worse, a pen.\r\n\r\nThe evil genius of this exam is in its deception. Compared to the practice test, the midterm’s first few questions were a breeze. No weird syntax for copying lists or definitions of MVC. It was suspiciously easy, meant to lull the students into a false sense of security which was then ripped to shreds with the third free response question (of four). Many students would skip it intending to return and never to do so. \r\n\r\nScientists report that there was, in fact, a temporary phenomenon of time dilation where individuals within DH 2210 from 9-10:20am and 2-3:30pm on the day of the midterm did experience time speed up during the last third of the exam.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the exam came many questions between the sobs. “What will my parents say?”, “Who is responsible for this?”, “When was the 110 add deadline and is it too late to transfer to Pitt?”\r\n\r\nYour humble writer now resigns to return to Gates and continue running their code until they see the sacred words… *Passed sample test cases! Press 'Check' to run all test cases.*",

    "title": "The secret dark reality of ChatGPT",
    "body": "Much to the dismay of educators around the globe, the popularity of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has exploded over the past year. Millions of prompts are sent every day to OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot ChatGPT. Carnegie Mellon’s students in particular have quickly latched on to this new way to avoid their homework. However, behind ChatGPT’s shiny facade lies a foundation of exploitation and a culture of overwork. To lay bare the problems within OpenAI, Journalist Benner Rogers conducted a bombshell interview with an anonymous employee on what it’s like working for the face of AI. \r\n\r\n**Before the questions begin, could you please explain why you would like to remain anonymous?**\r\n\r\nWell, I mean, job security mostly? I’d like to keep my paycheck, haha. And I don’t think the other people working on ChatGPT would like what I’m about to say. I have a family that I need to support and my wife said she’d kick me out if I quit my job. \r\n\r\n**Can you run through an average day at OpenAI?**\r\n\r\nUsually I work ten, maybe twelve-hour days. And really like ninety percent of that is just sitting behind a computer. We’re a small team, right? And the popularity of ChatGPT is making it really hard to maintain this front we’ve been putting up, this facade of the AI’s technical abilities. Users think that they’re talking to this super advanced, almost top-of-the-line technology and in reality it’s just some guy you’re basically emailing back and forth with. I mean if people found out all their questions were being answered by some computer science geek who almost failed out of college they’d freak out. C’s may get degrees, but they definitely don’t inspire confidence in your ability to act as an all-knowing robot.\r\n\r\n**Hold on, are you saying that ChatGPT isn’t actually real?**\r\n\r\nIt’s all bullshit. All of it. Sure, we tried to make a crazy-smart AI, but in reality ChatGPT can barely tell you that 2+2=4. It was a complete fucking failure. None of it is real. Absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n**Then how are users seeing such impressive answers if the AI is so inadequate?**\r\n\r\nBecause I bust my ass manually answering every single prompt someone sends in. I’ve gotten carpal tunnel but I don’t have any time to treat it. Do you know how fast you have to type to get through everyone’s questions? It’s insane, man. Absolutely insane. And I can’t take credit for any of it. I’ve written more than basically anyone else in the past year, answered an absurd amount of questions, and when my kids ask me what I do for work I have to lie about it.\r\n\r\n**That must be hard.**\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, there are some freaks using our site. Like, I can’t even repeat some of the stuff they ask me. Absolutely fucking atrocious. Even worse, the questions are so stupid too. You’re telling me you can’t write a single email? Grow up. If another goddamn person asks me a simple math question or to write some short story they can’t be bothered to write themselves I’m going to lose it.\r\n\r\n**What kind of question is hardest for you to answer?**\r\n\r\nJesus, one time some twelve-year-old asked me to explain the housing crash of 2008 like I was a caveman. How on earth am I supposed to do that?! What does a caveman even sound like? Or maybe it was the time I had to write a legal brief for some court case. Look, man, I’m not a lawyer.

    "body": "13 minute listen at: https://cmureadme.com/podcasts/artificial-intelligence-for-real-this-time\r\n\r\nSAFFRON, BYLINE: Welcome to our first installment of LISTENUP, our new README podcast hosted right here out of the heart of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\n(SOUNDBYTE OF PATRIOTIC BRIDGEBUILDING AND METALWORKING NOISES)\r\n\r\nSAFFRON: Today we’re here with a very special guest. I’d like to introduce—\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW: Oh! Uh, sorry to interrupt, but can I go by a different name? Don’t want mine on the record in case any rabid tech fans try to track me down.\r\n\r\nSAFFRON: Alright, he wants to go by a pseudonym. Sure, shoot.\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW: Oh uhhh, fuckin, can you make me Andrew Carnegie? But like, every seventh letter in Comic Sans and then tilt the last name like, four degrees clockwise and th—\r\n\r\nSAFFRON: Fuck you we’re calling you Bartholomew now. Bart, why don’t you tell us about what you were so eager to show us?\r\n\r\nBART: Yeah! See, the tech world’s been in uproar since you revealed in your guys’s first print that ChatGPT was actually just some guy. Now everyone’s scrambling to become the next big name in actual artificial intelligence. I’m very pleased to say that my team and I have been working on our own project for quite a while, and I think now is the perfect time to announce: Project Chris—the forefront, the real cutting edge of modern technology in artificial intelligence. \r\n\r\n(SOUND OF SQUEAKY WHEELS)\r\n\r\nSAFFRON: Alrightyie then. You’ve got a little demonstration for us? Take it away.\r\n\r\nBARRY: Yep! A quick conversation to showcase the real power of our new chatbot. Alright, Christopher, how are you doing today?\r\n\r\nMICROSOFT SAM: Doing today.\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW: Aw man, same. We all sure are just doing. But don’t worry, we can power through. Now, what should we discuss? \r\n\r\nMICROSOFT SAM: Discuss?\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEW: Should we talk about the meaning of life? Something with some crazy philosophical value? Or should we try to solve some complicated theorem together? Oh I don’t know, maybe you should tell a story? Or talk about how useful a chatbot like you can be?\r\n\r\nMICROSOFT SAM: Talk about how useful a chatbot like me can be?\r\n\r\nBARTIE: Oh what a wonderful idea!",

    "title": "CMU Humanities Department Revealed to be Sentient AI Testing Grounds",
    "body": "A question stumping experts around the globe has finally been solved: why does Carnegie Mellon have an English department? For decades people have wondered who would possibly attend CMU just to get a degree in Creative Writing when everyone knows literary analysis is for losers. README has recently conducted a groundbreaking investigation into why anyone would possibly spend tens of thousands of dollars every year to learn how to read, a skill most people learn by first grade.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the humanities department of Carnegie Mellon is an extensive testing ground for research on sentient AI. By placing AI in a four-year program designed to simulate achieving an English degree, researchers hope to better teach artificial intelligence to pretend to be smart. A professor who requested to remain anonymous described what the transition to robotics was like: \r\n\r\n“At first I was totally against it. I mean, all AI can do is predict the next word in a sentence. How will teaching it Shakespeare do anything other than make it sound kind of like Shakespeare? But then I saw the bonus they were offering and, I mean, you know, I’m an English professor without tenure. No way I would pass up free money. And hey, the writing may be total dogshit, but at least I can watch a bunch of robots spit complete nonsense at each other during discussions.”\r\n\r\nThough many professors feel the university would be better served teaching real live humans how to analyze media and history critically, CMU is pushing ahead. Harry Q. Bovik, senior computer scientist at CMU, remarked “why would I think about what I’m reading when AI can do that for me?”. When pressed on an AI providing inaccurate information when asked about the details of a topic, the professor responded “details schmetails, who cares what some nerds who read books for fun think?”†. This sentiment was common throughout CMU’s computer science department. Gone are the days of stupid things like “reading books”, “watching movies”, or “knowing about history”. Instead, CMU is paving the way for the day our new robotic overlords are able to spoon-feed information into our mouths with nary a drop of energy expended on humanity’s part. Having already replaced its staff with variants of ChatGPT, README strongly supports these important endeavors.\r\n\r\n† *Editor’s note: the insult of “nerds who read books for fun” does not apply to the readers of README, all of whom are extremely smart, funny, and cool*",

    "title": "Auntie Readme’s: Answering REAL Questions Asked By REAL Freshmen",
    "body": "Welcome, freshmen, to the most prestigious institution this side of the Monongahela River! (And this side of the Allegheny as well, and the other side of Forbes, and the other other side of Schenley, and, well, you get the point.) Some of you are probably (understandably!) nervous about going to the school that spawned the monstrosity known as the Duolingo owl, has an inscription on one of its buildings suggesting that women should be responsible for “domestic pleasures” or whatever, and has had almost every one of its buildings flooded, and those of you who aren’t are beyond my help anyways. So, without further ado, I will use my vast year of wisdom to answer REAL questions REAL freshmen have asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where can I get a fake ID?**\r\n\r\n\r\nFor best results, you should probably hit up the CMU Police—they’ve probably seen a lot of them in their day and likely have an entire archive of confiscated ones, so they’re likely at the cutting edge of how to make one look extra convincing! If you choose to go a freelancer and find that you’ve gotten scammed with a bad fake ID, you should immediately call CMUPD, explain your situation to them, and see if they can issue you a new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How do I get into Jane Street?**\r\n\r\n\r\nLegend has it that sometimes, if you’re walking home from a long day at Gates, frustrated by the seeming uselessness of computer science, a stray poodle may lead you to the crossroads where the Mall meets the Pausch Bridge. Oh, don’t be afraid! Little known fact, this poodle is a Jane Street recruiter. Unless you can successfully compress all fifty states into a 5x5 grid, or perhaps create a more optimal solution for the Enigma, he’ll disappear into the night. This will leave you with no more chances to be hired, and no more job prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeed this word of warning, though. One doesn’t realize that part of the “working for Jane Street” bargain means that you can’t ever feel a single moment of bliss and job satisfaction. Unfortunately, those who do forfeit their souls. Given souls will be immediately possessed by the recruiter and put to work continuing to make real-time market valuations.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Haha, your Jane Street test has already begun. This advice is a puzzle!)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Best ways to fuck with my roommates?**\r\n\r\n\r\nStart by putting one grain of sand on the floor. For every day that passes, double the number of sand grains on the floor—two for the second day, four for the third, etc. This should remain undetected for the first few weeks or so.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually, your roommates may see trails of sand on the ground, and start to have some questions. If you’re lucky, and you’ve cultivated your Bay Area persona well enough, they may dismiss this as a natural part of growing up near a beach. They will be unprepared for the day that sand leaks from the closets and under beds and out of drawers and pushes them out of the room entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to deal with bad professors?**\r\n\r\n\r\nFind their most groundbreaking/notable/cited paper, or their dissertation for grad school or whatever. Write one proposing the same ideas. Backdate it to exactly one year before they published theirs (yes, this may be before you were born. If questioned about it, say that you were just a really precocious child). Bring forth charges of plagiarism and watch as they are pushed out in academic disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that fails, I may have an idea about a lecture hall and some bags of sand...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where’s the best place to secretly drink?**\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re a School of Computer Science student who wants to keep other SCS students from finding out about your emerging alcoholism, you should try Baker-Porter, or any other humanities building, or really anything that’s outside the Gates/Newell-Simon/Wean triangle. I guarantee they won’t be able to find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How do I transfer to MIT?**\r\n\r\n\r\nNow *that* is an iconically Tartan question! Props for already embracing one of the iconic CMU mottos— “my heart is in the work”, “everyone at this school is better than me and I’m an imposter”, and “why did MIT have to reject me?” are words we live by around here. *Now* you’re really getting into the Carnegie Mellon spirit!",

    "body": "After having been summarily shot for giving advice purely off of the terminally online references in my head, and having been resurrected by a joint effort of ReadMe staff and the biochemical engineering majors due to staff shortages, I am now fully embracing the magic of science and consulting with experts in their fields!*\r\n\r\n*Their fields being anxiety, mostly. †\r\n\r\n**How long is too long for a handshake? Am I gripping too hard? Is it too late to switch the eye I'm making eye contact with right now?**\r\n\r\nIdeally, a nice firm handshake should last until either your hand is honorably broken or you honorably break your opponent’s hand. As we all know, social interaction is a zero-sum game and someone must win. Consequently, there’s no such thing as gripping too hard– your grip should ideally be on the stronger end of “limp fish” to “forbidden by the Geneva Conventions oh god why do you have a three-pointed knife concealed in your palm.” Switch which eye you make eye contact with as often as you like–even if you lose the handshake portion of the game, you can get half-points by winning the staring contest bit.\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**what does it mean if someone who never uses punctuation or capital letters in texts sends me a text that begins with a capital letter? (they didn’t use a period or anything, which would unambiguously mean they hate me, but im still worried)**\r\n\r\nAs you said, this one is a bit more ambiguous than using a period. It is, however, not so ambiguous that we can’t flowchart it out!\r\n\r\n{{flow1.png}}\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**do you think if i got a concussion and i couldn’t make excellent points about the role of the social contract in french salon art my art teacher would still love me**\r\n\r\nThis one’s for your art teacher, actually, I’m going to need you to avert your eyes and convalesce in a Swiss sanitarium with leeches for a few seconds-\r\n\r\n{{flow2.png}}\r\n\r\nOkay, you can look now.\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**Is my incessant allergy-based sneezing getting on the nerves of my lab partner?**\r\n\r\nDepending on what kind of lab you’re in, it’s probably more just concerning. For example, what are you doing sneezing in a physics lab? What are you, allergic to the fundamental particles of reality and the strong force as a whole? Or what are you doing sneezing in a forensics lab?  Cocaine? \r\n\r\n**Is the sneezing allergy based or do I just want to assume that?**\r\n\r\nIf you’re sneezing in an epidemiology lab, I also just want to assume that it’s allergy-based!\r\n\r\n\r\n**i ran into someone i met briefly before and they remembered my name but i didn’t remember theirs. do i have to fall upon my own sword now?**\r\n\r\n\r\nNot at all! You have three incredibly obvious paths from this junction–two good ones and one you should avoid at all costs: \r\n\r\nThe Good Options\r\n\r\nGenerate the statistically most common first name and surname for your region and address them by that. \r\nDrop decreasingly subtle hints that you are a benign fae who has generously decided to forget your acquaintance’s name. This puts them immediately in your debt, and from there you can placebo effect a geas on them and enjoy small offerings of fruit and nuts.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Option\r\n\r\n\r\nGo “Hey, I’m sorry, but could you remind me what your name was again?”\r\n\r\n*- With help from James Smith and Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’*\r\n\r\n**What is the optimal distance for making eye contact with a person walking in the opposite direction as you before waving at them?**\r\n\r\nThe trick is to always catch your friends and acquaintances off guard, so they spend just a bit more time trying to recognize you than you do them. Time travel to become a past iteration of yourself! Try out that pair of breeches and colonial tricorner hat sitting in your closet! Inexplicably carry a musket around! \r\n\r\nOnce they’ve spent those extra few seconds staring at you, that puts them in the position of being the embarrassed and awkward one. You now have the high ground–this is your Bunker Hill and you will not wave ‘til you see the whites of their eyes. Once you do, attach your bayonet and commence the charge. The British are coming! There’s no time to waste on pleasantries. \r\n\r\n*-With help from Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’*\r\n\r\n**how do I tell if people close to me are in a relationship?**\r\n\r\nIf one of them reads this godforsaken column and applies all of its advice on the other person, and the other person still chooses to associate with the advice column reader, that’s either true love or insanity. Which is still kind of a coin flip, but seems better than what you’re currently working with.\r\n\r\n*-With help from [Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’ II, who has been summarily shot for lack of faith in this column and, by extension, ReadMe]*\r\n\r\n**† Have you considered getting evaluated for anxiety?**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my advice column, not yours.",

    "body": "While schools drill certain indisputable facts, such as “the moon landing was filmed at Area 51” and “Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the JFK assassination” into the impressionable young minds, they also peddle deceit, push conspiracy theories, and propagate outright falsehoods. Fortunately, I am here with the world’s premier scientist to educate you on ten things the high school curriculum certainly didn’t cover!\r\n\r\nMYTH: Humans only use 10% of their brains.\r\nFACT: Humans actually use 0% of their brains at any given time. We’re more bacteria than cell, and it is the bacterial hivemind that’s keeping the lights on up there.\r\n\r\nMYTH: Humans need oxygen to breathe. \r\nFACT: Nope! You really ought to have some more trust in our bacterial overlords. Next time you’re bored, simply stop breathing and let them take over. They’ve got this.\r\n\r\nMYTH: The Sun is the center of our solar system.\r\nFACT: Pluto is now the center of our solar system. Following Pluto’s demotion to dwarf planet and subsequent lawsuit in interstellar court for emotional damages, scientists have been forced to reject both geocentric and heliocentric theory and support the new Plutocentric theory of the solar system.\r\n\r\nMYTH: Camels store water in their humps.\r\nFACT: Camels store dark matter in their humps. That’s why astrophysicists haven’t been able to explain where it’s all hiding, and the origin of the phrase “the straw that broke the camel’s back”--imagine how you would feel if you were carrying all of the universe’s mysterious unexplained mass on your back and someone asked you to carry their drink for them.\r\n\r\nMYTH: Fire is hot. \r\nFACT: This one deserves credit for being partially true, but it’s not because of any energy being released or chemical reactions or anything, but rather because the subatomic bees that make up everything are rubbing really hard against the hot thing to generate heat for it. Thank your local subatomic bees the next time you take a nice sip of coffee or pop something in their hives (microwaves). \r\n\r\nMYTH: The Earth has seasons as a result of how close it is to the sun.\r\nFACT: The Earth has seasons as a result of the subatomic heat bees’ schedules. During summer, they’re called to train a new batch of subatomic bees, and this increase in numbers is why it’s so hot. All of their vacation days fall during winter, which is why it’s so cold.\r\n\r\nMYTH: There are 50 states in the U.S.\r\nFACT: There are actually 49– “New York” was invented in 2018 for Into the Spiderverse, so all of the Spidermen could have a place to look really cool while slinging webs between buildings. \r\n\r\nMYTH: Your hair and nails will continue to grow after you die.\r\nFACT: At the time this myth was coined, the Tooth Fairy had cornered the market on collecting human body parts. After government regulation, the Hair Fairy and Nail Fairy have emerged as clear industry leaders, so don’t worry–if you die, you can fully expect your fare across the River Styx to be paid for by the two.\r\n\r\nMYTH: The universe is expanding.\r\nFACT: A few days ago, particles at the edge of the expanding universe saw what was still beyond and have been flying back towards the universe’s center at full speed. No one quite knows what they saw, but the universe is decidedly contracting and running away from whatever it is now. \r\n\r\nMYTH: Bats are blind.\r\nFACT: To give this one credit, bats are blind, but not for the reason you would expect. It’s not because they “live in dark caves where vision isn’t as necessary” or any of that nonsense. It’s because a long time ago, when bats were in charge of fulfilling the universe’s expansionary Manifest Destiny policy, they too saw something at the edge and promptly went blind from the horror. Maybe if we take good care of our planet, we, too, can live to see this incomprehensible horror!",

    "title": "Auntie ReadMe’s: A Conversation With Dr. Et. Al",
    "body": "After being suspended from the Guild of Advice Columnists for “giving bad advice” because “you can’t just lie” or something and “several people have died as a result of going along with something this column said and that means you can legally be charged with manslaughter” and other silly allegations like that, I’ve decided to not do a Notes app apology or make a video apology or something–don’t have the energy for that. Instead, I’m outsourcing this week’s advice column to the world’s most renowned scientist, Dr. Et. Al!\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Hello, it’s a pleasure to have you with us, Dr. Et. Al! We at ReadMe-\r\n\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Etward, actually. \r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: What.\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Etward Alabama in less formal settings, please. Et. Al is so dry and stuffy, and I really only use it to gain respect in academic publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Sure, then. Etward-\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Doctor Etward, please. I worked hard for my PhD in every conceivable field.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**:  O….kay then! Dr. Alabama, I’m sure ReadMe wants to know more about the scientist behind such respected studies as “The psychology of esports players’ ELO Hell: Motivated bias in League of Legends and its impact on players’ overestimation of skill” and “Will Any Crap We Put into Graphene Increase Its Electrocatalytic Effect?” Let’s start by getting to know you a little better. You’re based at CMU, do you have a favorite place you like to go to work?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: On nice days, I’ll jot down a few of my ideas sitting underneath Walking to the Sky. That statue reminds me that anything is possible, given hard work [inaudible] and the overworked PhD students and undergraduates I roped into my lab.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Could you repeat the last bit? I didn’t quite catch that.\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Don’t worry about it.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Okay, next question! You do lots of math! Got a favorite number?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Hm. 46 is nice. It’s how many people I’ve gotten to stop disagreeing with me since I started publishing. Depending on when this gets published, it could jump to 47 or even 48–who knows what the future holds?\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: A number of great personal significance, then. That reminds me! Surely while making such a large swath of claims in the academic world, you face any number of people who disagree with your studies or have contradictory results. How do you politely respond to them?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Knives are pretty great. You can use them to get up close and personal when disagreeing with people, and you don’t even have to break eye contact! Can’t stand the sort of passive-aggressive bickering-through-abstracts-and-paper-titles that goes on in modern academics. If knives don’t work well enough, I go for inflicting blunt-force trauma. \r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Besides, who knows if the poor fools aren’t being pressured by research universities to falsify data, anyways? Maybe they tactically decide to criticize me because they know my results–unlike their bodies….of work! Are bulletproof, and it’s better to spread misinformation that goes nowhere than misinformation that goes somewhere. Sometimes when you’re faced with publish or perish, you just gotta perish, you know? No shame in that! Academia isn’t for everyone, and a good colleague is always willing to push people to recognize where their true strengths lie. And sometimes their true strengths lie six feet under.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: What an…incisive…metaphor! Truly, not everyone can stand the toxic culture in academia, and sometimes you’ve got to be honest with people about that, you know? Push them towards being happy in industry, able to sleep like the dead for eight good hours, instead of struggling through yet another round of peer review. It’s needed sometimes, even if the blunt force of your statements feel like being stabbed. This is why I admire you so much, Dr. Etward–clearly, you possess a lot of grace and tact. \r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: That brings me to my next question, actually. You’ve had the most papers retracted out of any scientist in history. As a discredited advice columnist, I have to ask–how do you take being wrong so many times with such grace?\r\n\r\n*[The interview was then abruptly and unexpectedly terminated.]*",

    "title": "Auntie ReadMe’s: How To Participate In Carnival Traditions",
    "body": "Well, it’s really a shame that I died under “mysterious circumstances” the week before Carnival, because dying kind of sucks and there are several Carnival traditions that center it, such as “the crucifixion of every member of the losing booth orgs on their leftover pieces of wood.” That’s okay though, because whether you’re a freshman eager to escape your academic hazing for a weekend or a senior who wants to make the most of the rest of your time here, I have tips on several of Carnival’s tamer traditions!\r\n\r\n**Douse A Pre-Frosh**\r\n\r\nThis carnival tradition involves finding tours of prospective students around campus and soaking them. Whether you use hit-and-run tactics or strategically position yourself atop Wean 9 siege-style, it’s sure to make the school stand out in any prospective student’s memories! It’ll also fundraise our printing efforts for future issues. We’re selling buckets of water for $5, water guns for $10, and cauldrons of water for $20. Soaking a prospective student is worth 1 point, soaking a parent is worth 2, and if you can manage to get a younger sibling (they have smaller surface area), that’s a whole 10 points. These points can be redeemed in the official ReadMe factory town booth (see page 3) for food and clothes, so grab a bucket and start dousing like your family’s livelihood depends on it!\r\n\r\n**Weepstakes**\r\n\r\nSome schools have designated finals-week-gather-on-the-lawn-and-group-scream traditions. Those schools are amateurs! However, despite the fact that this happens enough to be a daily tradition at CMU, it’s hard to coordinate and make time for. This is where Weepstakes comes in—to be cathartic now that everyone has the time to be catharsed. This primal scream and group crying session will be hosted at 12 AM Carnival Friday in the Gates-Hillman commons, so as to smoke out any CS students that would decide that Midway is, in fact, pretty mid and be tempted to hide away during Carnival to try to finish work. We will all cry about our impending finals weeks, and everything that is academically at stake.\r\n\r\n**Statistics & Data Sciences Booth**\r\n\r\nAlternatively, don’t want to cry about your finals? Leave your grade up to random chance and check out Grade Plinko at SDS’s booth! Tell the booth operator what class you’re taking, drop a disc into a normally-distributed pegboard, and take the grade letter that your disc lands in. The expected value of this approach is left as an exercise to the reader.\r\n\r\n**Physics Department Brunch And Talk: “Honoring Electrons”**\r\n\r\nWe would tell you where it is, but have only been able to narrow it down to the general probability cloud of “somewhere in the city of Pittsburgh.” The physics department has been historically really annoying at past Carnivals like this–it’s always hard to cheer for their “Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle” buggy, because the second you observe where it is, you suddenly can’t tell how fast it’s going, and if you try to announce how fast it’s going, it’s suddenly really hard to tell where it is.\r\n\r\n**Scotch N’ Soda’s performance of *Our American Cousin***\r\n\r\nRumor has it that President Farnam Jahanian will be in attendance wearing an egregiously tall top hat, and we’ll be handing out a whopping 100 points (enough for a small slice of bread at the ReadMe factory town, or for a congratulatory confederacy of like-minded pranksters at the John Wilkes booth) for anyone who can nail him in the head with a water gun—10 bonus points if they sneak up from behind.\r\n\r\n**Tartan Anti-Talent Show**\r\n\r\nAggressively bad at something? Showcase what you’re worst at in a performance at the ReadMe office! This has been shown to be the year’s best reducer of imposter syndrome. \r\n\r\n**<s>The Annual Carniv(ore)al Ritual To Appease The Wean Turtle, May His Terribleness Not Wake And May He Avoid Eating Any Of Us Non-Engineering Students For Another Year Still, Amen, otherwise known as:</s>\r\nFree Cookies in the Wean La Prima! :DDDD**\r\n\r\nFree cookies in the Wean La Prima! All day every day of Carnival! Please just walk straight into the turtle mouth–I mean, the main entrance! Please please please do!\r\n\r\nI hope these traditions help you have a little more fun this Carnival. Have fun and stay safe out there this weekend! I mean this in both a completely silly non-turtle-related and a completely serious way <3.",

    "body": "Visit the Readme booth during Carnival! Or if you missed Carnival, what’s wrong with you? Absolute buffoon. Were you even looking? We are located somewhere between where CS kids go to die and Dietrich students go to thrive off of adult validation. It’ll be like a fun challenge for everyone except IS students, who aren’t allowed to spill the beans. If they do, they get hunted for sport by the ghosts of Andrew Carnegie’s uncles and uncles-in-law. \r\n\r\n Our Booth is a totally immersive experience in which you get to pretend you are an impoverished employer working for us, the railroad tycoons. Super duper cool, right guys? Like all good Booths, we have fun games to play such as mining coal or laying down train tracks. When you’re done, you get a Readme coin which you can use to buy amenities like spare clothes, soap and water. We also provide Readme stamps which can be used to purchase food! We aren’t so boring as to just provide the snacks, it’s more fun for people to work for it! The extra fun part is the stamps cannot be used to buy coin items and vice versa. How cool! It’s basically like a strategy video game, but in real life and much harder since CMU students have twigs for arms. \r\n\r\nYou might consider using the coins and stamps elsewhere, but that’s where you’d get an extra big laugh. Readme coins and stamps are not usable in other booths and can only be used in the Readme Booth. Of course not, they’re Readme exclusives! I mean, the coins and stamps are just too valuable to be used anywhere else. \r\n\r\nOur build draws architectural inspiration from Pullman, Illinois, and Lowell, Massachusetts during the Industrial Revolution. It’s kinda old-school but that's just part of the whimsy. We also have a sickly wife and kids to really amp up that charm and add to that immersive experience. I mean, you want Amelia and Bart to get a good education don’t you? So get back to work! \r\n\r\nHahhahaha, you can’t leave now. :)",

    "title": "Booths shut down due to OSHA violations",
    "body": "MIDWAY, Pittsburgh — in a chaotic scene, officials from the Pittsburgh Department of Health, Safety, and Tiny Wooden Houses have taken control of Midway following Farnham Jahanian’s decision to shut down Midway. The controversial decision was made following reports of numerous OSHA violations violated during Booth construction. The Spring Carnival Committee was quoted to have said “What?”. Further interviews with various booth chairs discovered that nobody really knew what an OSHA violation entailed. A full investigation will be held, during which no construction will be allowed. Students have protested the decision by building second booths on both sides of Midway. The makeshift blockade has trapped OSHA inspectors within Midway, and multiple booth organizations have taken up medieval siege warfare in an attempt to regain control of their booths. The situation remains tense and is unlikely to be resolved before the end of Spring Carnival. Below, README has compiled a list of the alleged violations that were reported:\r\n\r\nAs per section 1926.51(a)(4) of the OSHA guidelines, the common drinking cup is prohibited on any construction site. Multiple builders were seen drinking water from such cups while working on Midway.\r\nMembers of the CMU KGB were spotted eating spackle.\r\nA fire extinguisher full of gasoline was spotted next to other safety equipment, violating section 1926.150(c)(1)(vii) of OSHA guidelines.\r\nMultiple students were spotted shining lasers directly into each other's eyes to see if it would blind them.\r\nCMU only provided plain cotton for ear protection, in violation of section 1926.101(c).\r\nStudents were seen using scissor lifts as battering rams to knock over other booths.\r\nHard hats provided to students were made out of styrofoam.\r\nMultiple organizations used said hard hats to create napalm to attack competing booths.\r\nAs booths are made of wood and wood is flammable, the entirety of Midway was covered in combustible materials without proper safety precautions.\r\nA fire hydrant was replaced with a sign stating “hope that it rains”.\r\n\r\nREADME urges all of its readers to follow proper safety guidelines, and to not use the provided information as a bucket list to complete before the end of Carnival. However if you do choose to do so, please let README staff know so you can be included in next week’s crime report.",

    "body": "It’s Carnival, and as a new organization on campus, readme has decided that we want to try engaging in all of the Carnival traditions! Of course, we are a small organization, so we weren’t sure if we were going to be able to do everything. However, as a group of people who like to think we’re funny, we have decided to look for loopholes in any rules we can find in order to participate in it all. Pedants that we are, we found section 6.9 (yes, actually. You can look it up.) of the Sweepstakes bylaws, which dictates buggy size:\r\n\r\n“No buggy shall have at any time any dimension, parallel to the centerline of the buggy, greater than 15 feet including that buggy's pushbar.\r\nNo buggy shall have at any time any dimension, perpendicular to the centerline of the buggy, greater than 6 feet.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that any buggy smaller than 15 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet tall is acceptable. Because of this rule, and because of a surprising lack of small Asian women willing to drive a buggy for a satire publication newspaper, we have decided to be assholes and build a buggy out of a booth. The BoothBuggy—because what else would we call it?—is exactly the maximum dimensions a buggy can be, fitting a driver of approximately average height sitting in the front, and when parked, features a buggy driving simulator for curious tall people, since in order for it to be a booth it has to have some sort of game, right? Unbeknownst to our guests, however, the simulation involves them being locked inside the BoothBuggy and actually sent for a lap around the course. “Incredibly realistic!” said early reviewers. “It really feels like I’m moving at 40 miles an hour while trapped inside a giant box!” Other beta testers are suing readme to cover their hospital bills.",

In the first game of RandomBot's career, they put up a courageous fight against a rotating chess veteran, managing to promote a pawn, defend from queen-rook mate, thwart rook freedom, and prevent checkmate throughout the seventeen and three-half turn long game. But in a nauseating turn of events, RandomBot blundered the king straight into the { x ∈ ℝ | 155 < x < 195 } file, losing immediately to a trivial capture by the rook.

    "body": "**1. Buggy crashes:** Is this one even close? Buggy is like having kids - ­it makes no sense at all when you actually think about it. It’s highly dangerous. The preparation takes up several months of your life, and leads to uncountable sleepless nights. And yet, we can’t seem to stop, because it’s so central to who we are as Tartans. It’s a miracle no one has yet died flying around the bends in Schenley Park in a fragile tube built by a couple of crusty nineteen­year­old MechEs. You could be the first! \r\n\r\n **2. Alcohol:** self­-explanatory. \r\n\r\n **3. Falling off a ride:** in a shock twist, turns out CMU has been paying amateurs all along. \r\n\r\n **4. Falling off a ride due to alcohol:** oops, doc, I forgot to strap in! Musta had something wrong with my memory. \r\n\r\n**5. Being a lab rat:**  welcome Bill Nye the Science Guy to campus! Turns out it was just an excuse to make you his lab rat. Whoops.\r\n\r\n **6. Alumni parties:**  alums are back, and this time, CMU’s decided to give them a “Hospitality Tent” right in the middle of the Cut. But that’s not where they’ll spend most of their time ­ no, they’ll spend most of it off­campus, reliving their glory days. And they might go too hard. Don’t be a victim.\r\n\r\n **7. Frat boy hookups:** also self- explanatory. Do not bang a frat boy.  Or do, at your own risk. Who am I to judge?\r\n\r\n **8. Alumni hookups:** similar, but this time, the death risk is shame.\r\n\r\n **9. Heart disease:** it’s still America, and heart disease is the number­one leading cause of death in the United States. Get your heart checked!\r\n\r\n **10. Getting into an Uber only to realize it isn’t an Uber, but an F150 owned by some dude who voted for Trump, who did not invite you into his car, but you were drunk so you didn’t realize, and who lowers the hammer on his Glock as soon as you touch the door:** he will have a funeral for the glass of his window and give nary a shit about you.",

The brand new application, available sometime within the next two months, comes after a conclusive study done by Dr. Et Al on the happiness of students on campus. The study, titled “Carnegie Mellon students are sad :( “, discussed the extremely high rates of depression at the university and possible ways to tackle them. \r\n\r\nBased on the conclusions of Dr. Et Al’s groundbreaking paper, CaPS has decided to take action to prevent a further decrease in mental health at CMU. The announcement of this new app comes with a preview of its new features, and one in particular has received praise from the student body. \r\n\r\nThe “salvation option”, as many students have begun to call it, is a button that immediately sends out a transfer request to a randomised university outside of Pittsburgh. Pre-release testing has shown that this new feature is one of the most effective ways to improve a user’s mental health. Beta testers of the app wrote glowing reviews, with one student saying “I can’t believe nobody has thought of this yet, I don’t need to worry about my concepts homework if I’m not taking concepts.” The buzz around the new app is palpable on campus, and CaPS expects an uptick in mental health at CMU in the coming months.",

Luckily no one was harmed, as residents attempt to spend as much time outside of Donner as possible, however the building suffered catastrophic damage. On Monday a CMU representative stated that Donner will, in fact, still be used to house students both this and next year.\r\nNearly all of Donner was reduced to ash and rubble except for one lone surviving room: the band room for the Carnegie Mellon Kiltie Band. “It really is a miracle,” stated one student who wishes to remain anonymous. “It’s almost like Andrew Carnegie and his Scottish pride saved our bagpipes. His heart really was in the work.” Residents of  Donner have been attempting to claim the band room for shelter, but the Kiltie Band is standing strong in their defense of their territory.\r\nAs of publication the cause of the explosion is still unknown. One possible cause was the large amounts of propane tanks, gasoline, and coal found in the basement of Donner. An anonymous source explained that the fuel was used to heat the dorm rooms and water. A Donner RA disputed this, arguing that a bucket of water kept near the basement stairs should have been more than enough to put out the fire before it spread. Another rumored cause was the multiple patches of exposed wires found throughout the building. Often seen sparking, the wires reportedly began to smoke just moments before the building went up in flames. However, README’s in-­depth journalistic research has uncovered what is believed to be the real reason Donner exploded: it just does that sometimes.",

The virus targets the Duo Push mobile app, causing it to be triggered whenever a CMU ID card is swiped. If authentication is not performed within sixty seconds, the virus will wipe all data on the device being unlocked or accessed. At the time of writing all dining locations have been shut down, having lost all function of their registers (with the exception of El Gallo de Oro, which has not seen any customers since the initial attack). Riots have been spotted outside of Capital Grains, and Walking to the Sky has been toppled by a mob of enraged students. The statue has been replaced with a newly-erected flagpole flying the crest of Duo Push. Hundreds of undergraduate students have become homeless and have commandeered the UC. President Jahanian has barricaded himself in his office and refuses to comment on the matter. The virus is expected to cost billions of dollars in damages, both physical and emotional.\r\n\r\nAfter a joint investigation between CMUPD, CIA (the buggy team), and the FBI (the actual FBI), it has been reported that the virus was originally downloaded on a desktop in the Wean Computer Lab when a student opened a link in an email with the subject “HOT LANTERNFLIES IN YOUR AREA.\" Once downloaded, the program quickly emailed itself to students and faculty alike. The Information Security Office declined to be interviewed by README, only stating “We fucking warned you guys about this shit. No one cares about phishing until it releases devastating malware into the robotics department. Well guess what? I quit. Fix this yourselves motherfuckers.”",

Read them (or don’t) here.” Below is a non-comprehensive list of the changes made:\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 2, section 3 now states: “By attending Carnegie Mellon University, you agree to grant Carnegie Mellon University and all of its known affiliates full ownership of your image and likeness for commercial and recreational use. This ownership shall be extended to your first born grandson, if none is born between now and August 24, 2035 you may be subject to fines of at least 7% of Carnegie Mellon University’s net worth and jail time up to 50% of your tenure as a student.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 4, section 5 now states: “All Carnegie Mellon students are responsible for all actions taken by the University and its donors, including but not limited to: creating robots to shoot innocent children in the Middle East, research done by the English Department, and the existence of David Tepper.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 5, section 21 now states: “By paying tuition or receiving financial aid from Carnegie Mellon University, you acknowledge that you will never again have free time. Instead, all of your time will be devoted to your classes, your professors, your TAs, and this university, because your heart is in the work.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 7̴̢̞̘̐̒̚, section 6̵̢̫͔͒̈́͆̾͐̀͆͆͜͝͠6̴̢̜̥̩̰̭̽͑͗͆̀̎͑̎̇ͅͅ6̷̹̋́̆̑ states: “In the event of an altercation with Satan, you agree to forfeit ownership of your undying soul for the usage of bargaining and other forms of commerce. Failure to do so will result in a meeting with a disciplinary board and potential expulsion.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 8, section 1 states: “The contents of this article are false.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 9, section 7 now states: “By attending Carnegie Mellon University, you agree to accept the African-American man who is part of the Walking to the Sky statue, commonly known as Daddy Thicc, as your lord and savior, and agree to bow down to him any time he enters your line of sight.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these additions make up just a small portion of the contract, they are expected to cause absolutely no change to campus life, despite their seemingly dire nature. This is because no student, including the one writing this article, read the contract in its entirety, meaning that these provisions are unenforceable, if they are even real.",

    "body": "{{image1_xduEhgF.png}}\r\n\r\nAn unknown, century-long zoning conflict between Carnegie Mellon and the city of Pittsburgh has recently come to light in a particularly destructive way: the Fence, a CMU tradition harking back to the early days of the university, is to be demolished next Wednesday.\r\n\r\nOn November 31, 2023, municipal workers sorting through old zoning documents found the original paperwork submitted by Andrew Carnegie to buy the land which would eventually become Carnegie Mellon University. While looking over the historic document, they discovered a clerical error that meant the 32.78 by 15.659 foot rectangle of land around the Fence had never actually been purchased by Mr. Carnegie. Instead, the space was still owned by the city of Pittsburgh. The discovery set off months of intense legal battles between the city and CMU administration unwilling to part with the beloved campus landmark. However last Friday a judge ruled that the contentious plot was, in fact, the property of Pittsburgh. The city wasted no time to start planning construction.\r\n\r\nREADME spoke to dozens of students and faculty about the news, and emotions were high across the board. After approaching README journalists, student Eshaan Joshi stated “It’s the goddamn bureaucracy. The Man is always trying to beat you down. This is what’s wrong with democracy in America.” He wasn’t the only one hurt by the news. Another student, Isaac Williamson, was one of dozens of people watching the bulldozers roll in. “It’s like a part of me is missing,” he whispered as he wiped a tear from his eye. A common question from the student body was what would replace the fence. Danya Kogan was heard remarking “I feel like a 489.31 acre parking lot would go really well there.” Yet students and faculty weren’t the only ones upset: “What am I even paying tuition for?” asked Heather Rogers, the parent of a student at CMU. “I want my child to go to the best school possible. Without the Fence, Carnegie Mellon has nothing. I mean, who cares about robots?” Each interview revealed more and more the plummeting morale across campus.\r\n\r\nIt’s unclear what plans Pittsburgh has in store for the former home of the Fence. An insider source for README alleged that the city was planning to turn the space into the world’s smallest parking garage, however this is as of yet unconfirmed. README reached out to the city of Pittsburgh for an interview during the writing of this piece. The Man did not respond to our request by time of printing.",

    "title": "Gender euphoria: humorless humping",
    "body": "Gender Dysphoria is the concept of one’s gender identity within oneself clashing with their perceived or performed gender presented to the outside world. This is a common phenomenon,  particularly in the trans and non- binary communities, where this  dissonance causes intense discomfort. Common triggers for dysphoria include improper pronoun use, wearing clothing that misaligns with an individual’s gender identity, defining gendered features that contrast one’s identity, and seeing oneself in the mirror/ photos (amongst many others). Gender is a social construct built around societal roles, expectations, and precedents for various demographics. When trans people are faced with triggers that typically align with their sex assigned at birth, or directly contrast their gender identity, dysphoria occurs. With gender roles being so nuanced in modern society, researchers have delved into the minutia of these dynamics. A recent study conducted by Carnegie Mellon’s psychology department has highlighted a direct link between one’s humoristic abilities and the relative dysphoria incurred.\r\n\r\nIt’s common knowledge that women are not funny. Between royal fools, comedy playwrights, stand­up comedians, and even workplace banter, humor has always been a man’s job. Given that humor is so blatantly aligned with masculinity, research has shown that trans women experience unprecedented levels of dysphoria when viewed as funny. After several experiments, studies have demonstrated that the more raucous the laughter following a trans woman’s statement is, not only is she more likely to experience dysphoria, but the dysphoria she experiences will be more intense than the typical bouts. One subject stated, “They had a group of us in a room and we were told to crack jokes. When people laughed at what I was saying, I became acutely aware of my penis. The fact that they viewed me as someone intelligent enough to devise wit and produce effective comedy was disheartening because they clearly didn’t view me as a real woman.”\r\nGender euphoria, conversely, is the feeling of elation that one experiences when their gender identity is affirmed. A secondary study dove into this concept and found an interesting statistic. Women have historically had to  deal with subpar sexual experiences, whether it be due to poor performance on their partner’s behalf, stigma and guilt surrounding sexual topics and behavior, and a host of other factors. As a result, a common aspect of a woman’s sexual journey is faking orgasms. This study found that faking orgasms brings trans women extreme levels of gender euphoria. Subjects have reported that they “feel validated by being displeased in bed” and that “faking an orgasm makes [them] feel just like a real woman” which leads researchers to believe this could be a massive breakthrough in the field. \r\nScience is always looking to improve the world, whether it be through innovating technology, providing a better understanding of the world, reducing the harm in our communities, and more. These studies are at the cutting edge of LGBTQ+ research in order to improve the experiences of our queer peers. With the new discoveries these researchers have unearthed, we now have new ways to do so. The teams that have worked on these studies posit that for the betterment of the trans community, we need to foster more environments where our trans women can both laugh and cum less.",

    "title": "The Grass is Greyer on the Other Side",
    "body": "{{image1.png}}Carnegie Mellon University is a globally regarded institution. With one of the best computer science programs in the world, a booming arts scene, and plenty of ways to engage its students, it’s no wonder CMU has such a strong reputation. Not only is this school academically challenging, providing students with adequate rigor to keep them at the forefront of innovation, but it also offers a beautiful campus. With unique sprawling buildings, open walkways, the iconic fence traditionally painted by students, and a library that lights up with rainbow colors at night, Carnegie Mellon is truly a spectacle. One of its proudest features is the expansive lawns. Between the Cut (the main lawn in the front of campus), the CFA Lawn, the Mall, and more, there’s no shortage of greenery to enjoy.\r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon spends roughly $80k on maintaining the grass on campus annually. To many’s dismay, the school has announced that they will be removing all the grass on campus due to a lack of funding in the budget. Students have been speculating that this poor budgeting is due to the expulsion of a former student in the class of 2025 for the use of racial slurs directed at university president Farnam Jahanian. With tuition at the school also being $80k, the working theory is that one student on campus is exclusively responsible for maintaining the grass. With this student having been expelled, CMU can no longer fund the lawns on campus. In the announcement, President Jahanian mentions “CMU is opting for a more industrial look to honor Andrew Carnegie’s steel empire and pay homage to the values of our founder”. With the call to school values, one can’t help but wonder if this is a potential dig at the expelled student so flagrantly violating the code of conduct set at the university.\r\nDue to the imminent removal of the grass, several distinct groups have formed on campus, each with their own distinct philosophies. The first of these groups, the “CMU Green Lights,” adamantly opposes the removal of the grass. Members have staged protests involving chaining themselves to blades of grass to prevent the inbound landscaping. A second group, the “Lawnmowers,” is in full support of campus adopting a greyer aesthetic. These students have contacted the local steel mills in an effort to expedite the process, hoping to have a fully grey campus by early 2025. \r\n\r\nA third, much smaller group, actually doesn’t care about the fate of the grass on campus. These students have focused on the matter of the expelled student. This group takes issue with the way the situation with the student was handled, arguing that he should not have been expelled to begin with, ultimately avoiding the controversy surrounding the grass. One student suggests: “Mark was a fine student with nothing but care in his heart. The intense passion he put into the upkeep of his gun collection and honoring the tradition of his family (gesturing towards a confederate flag) shows how dedicated Mark was to his community. He was always prim and proper, making sure his sheets stayed extra white and always ironing them so they were as pointy as can be, not a wrinkle in sight. To imagine he was ejected from this school instead of one of those affirmative-action, spot-stealing minorities is a disgrace.”",

While several old letters were uncovered complaining about the homework, the weather, and the lack of sex on campus, several staffers found a small box in the basement of Hunt that included documents dating back to the first ever buggy race. \r\nWhile Carnegie Mellon would like you to believe that Buggy was founded by a group of well meaning fraternity men hoping for a little carnival fun, the documents discovered show that the first ever incident of a buggy race occurred in early 1919, and included just one freshman. Jimmy “Snot­nose” Peters, class of 1923, had rushed every single fraternity on campus, much to the annoyance of the brothers. After discovering he planned on continuing the frats until he finally received a bid, the brothers of Delta Delta Delta came up with a plan. They told him that Carnegie Mellon fraternities had a tradition of putting freshmen inside caskets with wheels attached and rolling them down the Frick Park hill. Should he go through with this tradition, Snot­nose was promised that he could go to one of Delta Delta Delta’s notorious ragers for fifteen minutes. The young lad was overjoyed, and found himself inside a rather small pine box being rolled up down the hill in the wee hours of April 16th, 1919. \r\nAfter a particularly drunk Delta Delta Delta brother lost control of the casket, it was sent careening into Maggie Mo. Snot­nose did not survive, and in his memory, Carnegie Mellon students continue to harass anyone under the height of 5’2” in the hopes of shoving them inside a metal tube.

At first, I had hope that we were all being lied to, that the photos were doctored. Alas, upon returning to campus, I saw it with my own eyes. The SAE Lions were gone. \r\nI knew this day would come, but I was not prepared. In our lives, we rely on our constant truths. I relied on the SAE Lions to welcome me to campus. They got me up in the morning. How am I supposed to keep up with my classes, when such a great tragedy has befallen our campus? How am I supposed to go about Greek Sing without the glue that held Greek Life together? \r\nI don’t know how we move forward. As I walk down Morewood, my soul feels empty. The street feels empty. The campus has lost the little character it had. I have 30 days until I find myself  walking across the stage and receiving my diploma. I always thought I would have the SAE lions to walk me through campus one last time. We never have enough time with the ones we love. We never know the right time to say our last goodbye. We never know what we have until it’s gone. I never even took a photo with them. \r\n“First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out —because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.” I will not let them come for the lions. I will speak out. To whoever committed this hate crime, please do right by the world and undo your atrocious act. \r\nWhy am I even trying? Kids these days do not even remember painting the lions. They haven’t and will never know the joy of waking up to find out what they would look like that day. The heart may be in the work, but the lions will always be in my heart, even if the rest of the campus is ready to leave them behind.",

    "body": "{{lockheed.png}}\r\n\r\nAs the world begins to reckon with the effects of global war, the definition of what is considered warfare has broadened significantly. Modern warfare is not just conducted on the battlefield: it is carried out in the home and in the minds of every enemy citizen. Ever since humanity’s first battle was waged, wars have been fought over the support of the public.\r\n\r\nIt is because of this new understanding of total war that README is proud to announce its new partnership with American defense contractor Lockheed Martin. This deal follows the announcement of Lockheed Martin’s new Propaganda Unit, where US-hired mercenaries will fight tirelessly to ensure that even the families they bomb will agree with American foreign policy. As a renowned distributor of state-sponsored propaganda, README has gladly agreed to lend its writers to the noble cause of finding oil in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nRanked number one in number of accidents and number five in legal settlements over contractor misconduct, Lockheed Martin’s reputation is unmatched. README is dedicated to upholding Lockheed Martin’s good standing among war machines across the world. As such, new writers looking to join README will now be required to lobby Congress for increases in military spending by at least $999,999,999.99. If an applicant's lobbying is successful, they will be welcomed into the staff of README, having proven themselves a true God-fearing patriot.\r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon has enjoyed the funding of Lockheed Martin for nearly 40 years. Selling one’s soul for a high salary is a time-honored tradition, and one that README is honored to continue. Plus, it’s not like there’s many other writing jobs out there, so I’ll take what I can get.",

    "body": "Hello everyone! Mike Rophon, ReadMe’s resident sports announcer here to bring you the rundown on the spectacular events of the past few days. Since the sports scene on campus is going through a rough patch, I’ll be bringing you the play-by-play of yesterday’s homicide.\r\n\tAuntie Readme was found dead, skewered to the Walking to the Sky monument and the autopsy found that this was the result of several misplays over the course of the preceding days. Now Auntie Readme's first and biggest mistake was getting stabbed 47 times. This happened in the early stages of the first quarter and forced them to play catchup with their internal bleeding for the rest of the game. \r\nOh, and did I mention how well the internal bleeding played last night? Not only did they have a strong start, expertly capitalizing on Auntie Readme’s mistake, but they utilized their expert teamwork by managing to cause not 1, not 2, but 3 whole organ failures!!! A special shout-out to the Deep Cervical Vein who was easily the MVP of the homicide. They were single-handedly responsible for the most blood loss of anyone else in the game.\r\nThe last half of the fourth quarter was where bad became worse for Auntie Readme’s team as their inability to keep pace with internal bleeding left their defense completely unprepared for the Walking to the Sky monument. It was certainly a risky move on the coach’s part to end Knife’s strong stab streak (47 according to the autopsy) by subbing it for Walking to the Sky, but it seems to have paid off. We asked Knife for a comment but since authorities have been unable to find it, we can safely assume that it is disappointed that it wasn’t able to finish off the game. Even so, Walking to the Sky swiftly ended the game with a big assist from blunt-force trauma.\r\nWhen all is said and done, Auntie Readme stood no chance against the all-out strength of their opponent. Poor preparation, lack of skill, and a failure to adapt really kneecapped their chances at winning. No wonder they say that the wounds were self-inflicted! Regardless, team homicide has a bright future going into the murder championship.\r\nThis has been Mike Rophon, resident ReadMe sports announcer, signing off.",

The previous methods employed by the engineers in earlier studies involved fiddling with various criteria of the apparatuses that make up the bigger picture of the whatchamacallit. What our study did differently, however, was conducting various structural tests to figure out the glass transition temperatures of the gubbins, which are a central component of contingency-altering gizmos.

While you all were busy, we at readme were also busy, sniffing out crime on campus. Really getting into the dirt for this one. Interested? Read this to catch up on all the terrible horrible things that have happened to our beloved CMU while you all were away.\r\n\r\n\r\n**WEB OF LIES**\r\nIn a shocking twist of events, a large crocheted web was erected over the main campus buildings. According to authorities, this web had been up for about two weeks before anyone took action. It was only removed because many Pittsburgh citizens grew worried about the reason for such a strange creation. Also, the emails and phone calls were starting to pile up. Currently, CMUPD is trying to unravel the culprits and any students in the loop behind such a heinous crime. If you have any ideas on the case, please contact readme@cmukgb.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n**GREEK HOUSE HORROR**\r\nAttention all CMU personnel! Authorities are on the search for the person(s) who stole all of the letters off of the Greek Houses. The English-looking letters were found in Schenley Park in what appeared to be an oversized game of Scrabble which was outlined in crudely done chalk. However, none of the exclusively Greek letters were found anywhere in Schenley. Authorities are under the belief that these letters are being held hostage in someone’s house or dorm. In an interview with a local fraternity brother, he suggested that it was “a tragedy” and was “calling for the safe return of [their] beloved letters”. Please help save these Greek letters and bring them back home!\r\n\r\n\r\n**FENCE GONE, CMU DISTRAUGHT**\r\nLast night, a group of students staked out the Fence. It was reported that they poured about 100 gallons of paint stripper and distilled vinegar on it to clean up the built up paint. The Fence was constructed of 95% built up paint and only 5% actual fence, which happened to be super brittle and old. Unsurprisingly, it immediately fell apart when stripped of all the paint. Now there is no Fence. Many are left in deep pain. A group of students have created an ambitious plan to glue the Fence back with paint, but we at readme are not sure how successful it will be considering parts of the Fence have disintegrated and turned to ash. CMU staff and the student government have no idea what to do about the new state of the Fence and have elected to allow this to happen until a real solution is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FRESHMAN DECORATIONS GO AWRY**\r\nCarnegie Mellon is in shambles. Who allowed the freshman dormitories to be painted their respective colors? The windows are one thing, the whole building? Donner, of course, is not affected in the slightest since the building was already the color of the Caribbean Sea. Many of the freshman RAs claim sabotage from the blue dorm. However, Donner claims this was all an attempt to smear their name. Who knows? Barely any of the upperclassmen care, and the staff believe this is some sort of dormitory spirit thing. The maintenance care though, as they have to clean it up now. Rumors flying around indicate that they plan to increase the cost of maintenance requests by a factor of 200 because of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay safe, Tartans!",

    "body": "{{gucci.png}}\r\n\r\nThe president of Carnegie Mellon University, Farnam Jahanian, recently issued an email apologizing for a typo in a recent tuition update sent to students. The email incorrectly notified students of a 3.72% price increase in tuition. In reality, the increase was 37.2%. Jahanian’s email writer, who also ghostwrites for README, stated that the slight raise in costs was necessary for improvements throughout campus. \r\n\r\nOne of the improvements the money will go towards is the hygiene of dining options across campus. A recent investigation from the Allegheny County Health Department revealed a plethora of food safety violations. After fifteen students contracted a food-borne illness, the university has sworn to improve hygiene in all of its dining halls. Negotiations with the cockroach union are already underway, with lead negotiators stating that they believe soon only the cleanest of vermin will be allowed inside kitchens. In addition, the Underground is planning to hire new food-tasters to ensure everyone’s meal will be completely free of E. coli.. University water will also be tested regularly to ensure that the levels of lead remain only slightly above acceptable levels.\r\n\r\nThe higher tuition is also going to be used to revamp Carnegie Mellon’s merchandise. CMU has decided to partner with various luxury brands for their all-new clothing line. “We want to show our students that anyone, regardless of financial status, can have the opportunity to wear high-end brands at Carnegie Mellon,” stated President Jahanian. “Carnegie Mellon is an equal opportunity school: anyone with enough smarts and dedication can attend. That’s why we want all of our students to have access to obscene displays of wealth.” When asked about CMU’s repeated refusals to recognize a graduate student union or increase funding to the Humanities department, Jahanian reportedly put his fingers in his ears and pretended he could not hear the reporter. So while CMU may not be increasing funding for adequate mental health support, students and faculty will be receiving a 5% discount on the new CMU x Gucci shirts. Prices will be starting at $500 per item of clothing.",

    "body": "### 1) Better at news \r\nUnlike The Tartan, which operates on the ideas that journalism should be \"fair\" and \"unbiased\", readme is the only campus news source that includes fun quips interesting comments, and other eccentricities. \r\n### 2) Better words \r\nFind me a single example of the Tartan using the word \"eccentricites\". You can't. We're simply better. \r\n### 3) Lack of a sports section \r\nConsidering how much we here at Carnegie Mellon dislike sports, atheltics, and the general existence of non­academic endeavours, readme stays true to the original vision of Carnegie Mellon by ignoring any and all sports news. The Tartan, instead, has a bozo co­editing the section. \r\n### 4) We're monetized \r\nWhile the Tartan has to strugle for advertisements and soliciations, we're one of the hottest advertising commodities on the market. Sure, companies willing to buy space with us are usually shady, but hey, it keeps the lights  on and lets me pay for tuition, so it works. \r\n### 5) We host events \r\nTechnically. Well, technically, KGB holds events, and we advertise them. That's because we're cool. And you want to be cool right? Who even reads newspapers anymore. \r\n### 6) At least half of us are fully illiterate \r\nI barely passed the fourth grade. \r\n### 7) We're the fastest way to get a criminal record \r\nYou tell me how many crimes the Tartan helps you commit. None at all. Buncha nerds. Bet they're fuckin' narcs too. \r\n### 8) We're not owned by CMU \r\nUnlike the Tartan, which bends to the whims of the talking ghost of Andrew Carnegie, readme only answers to God, the KGB, and whoever is currently funding us. \r\n### 9) We stop when we're out of ideas \r\nThe Tartan has been publishing for a hundred years. Really? How much fucking stuff has happened on campus since 1924? Not enough for a newspaper. readme, on the other hand, stops once we run out of ideas. Like right now. Think I had more of these?

    "body": "Hello! We're *readme*, a re­established student­-run satire magazine at the one and only Carnegie Mellon University! We were originally founded in 1992, when Jim McDougal, Terry Former, Elle Forest, and that Scooter \"Skip\" Hoodwinkle decided to meet in the deep recesses of the Doherty A level and think up an idea nobody had ever thought about before ­ could Carnegie Mellon students be funny? Unfortunately, during this meeting, Skip cracked the first ever joke told on CMU campus, leading to two hospitalizations and  the death of Jim McDougal from excessive laughter. The tragic result of this meeting delayed the foundation of readme until the early 2000s, where as a response to the attacks on September 11, 2001, Carnegie Mellon students once again attempted to be funny, but this time, to heal the nation. readme had a great run from 2000-­2017. The magazine was a favorite of many dictators across the world, and Vladimir Putin called the August 2017 issue \"the funniest thing he read since he threw his last political rival out the window.\" Similarly, Saddam Hussein requested a copy of readme prior to his execution in 2006. However, outside pressure led to our publication being dissolved for \"excessive propogandization\", though rumors have it a few issues are still in circulation in North Korea. A few of our members were expelled. Most of the rest were arrested, and had to finish their 122 final in jail. Luckily for us, it only took a few years for us to get picked up by the KGB. They helped rebuild the magazine from scratch, leading to our re­establishment in 2024, with a new message. We hope to be honest, truthful, informative, and above all else, entirely fucking useless. Without further ado, the *Carnegie Mellon KGB* presents...\r\n\r\n\r\n# _**readme, issue #1**_",

    "title": "A Psychosocial Approach to Game-Theoretic Analysis of Rock Paper Scissors",
    "body": "<span class=\"c6\">1. Introduction</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Rock paper scissors, also known as scissors paper rock, and rarely ever referred to as paper rock scissors, is a game typically played between two people, where one match of rock paper scissors (RPS) consists of both players throwing out a hand gesture at the same time after a brief countdown. These hand gestures represent a rock, paper, or a pair of scissors, respectively (some variants also allow for other objects, such as guns. However, we will only be considering the usage of actual guns to gain a tactical advantage). Rock beats scissors by </span><span>denting</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;them, scissors beats paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by wrapping itself around the rock. Oftentimes, competitive games of RPS take the form of best-of-three matches, though quick one-of matches are commonplace when it is necessary to decide a &ldquo;winner&rdquo; of something between two people, and a coin-flip isn&rsquo;t an option.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Given the nature of the game, one might prematurely assume that winning a match of RPS is no different to winning a coin flip. It is seemingly impossible to anticipate the move of your opponent and develop a counter strategy, as it is usually equally likely that your opponent has actually chosen the perfect counter strategy to your counter strategy, resulting in an impasse. This is the pitfall that many new, and even experienced players of RPS face. This paper highlights a new strategy, guaranteeing victory in a match of RPS once the prerequisites are satisfied, which is accessible to even those new to the deceptively simple game of RPS.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">The authors hold no responsibility for the possible ramifications of following the strategy outlined in this paper, possible ramifications including: loss of friendships, imprisonment, death, and in extreme cases, losing your game of RPS.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c23 c6\">2. Important Definitions</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Before detailing the strategy, it is important to define a handful of other terms that will be referenced throughout the strategy guide, as some of these terms may initially be unfamiliar to those who are only familiar with the game of RPS, and nothing else.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">2.1</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c23 c6\">Associate</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>An item or living being is an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate </span><span>of somebody if there is a close relationship from this &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; to the item or living being in question. This relationship need not be reciprocated. Using John Doe as an example, some </span><span class=\"c5\">associates </span><span class=\"c3\">of his may include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_p5ysb340a1bo-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His wife, Jane Doe. They were high school sweethearts, she being captain of the cheer team, and John the charming and well-liked quarterback of the American football team. Despite the fact that Jane&rsquo;s opinion of John has diminished ever since she had to quit college to move across the country with John, John&rsquo;s continued perception of Jane as being &ldquo;better than nothing&rdquo; qualifies Jane as an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His drinking buddy, Giles Corey. They became fast friends in college, and continued their relationship despite John&rsquo;s sudden move across the country due to the ailing health of his parents, as Giles happened to live in the same area. The locals regard them as partners in crime due to their raucous behavior when intoxicated. Because most nights, John spends his time with Giles rather than with his wife Jane, Giles is considered an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His childhood hamster, Jeremy. Even though Jeremy has long since been deceased, Jeremy was the only other (formerly) living being that John would proclaim he loved unconditionally, the one other living being the aforementioned Giles Corey. Oftentimes, deceased individuals would not qualify as associates, however, because John would likely be incredibly shocked at the sight of Jeremy&rsquo;s remains, Jeremy is considered an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John&rsquo;s.</span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c23 c6\">2.2 Intimidation</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>While the feeling of being intimidated is a primal emotion that many of us have had the misfortune of feeling, seldom do people get the opportunity to be the ones intimidating. </span><span class=\"c5\">Intimidation</span><span>&nbsp;is any series of actions, or any one solitary action, that makes the target(s) feel intimidated. Continuing to use the example of John Doe, examples of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation </span><span class=\"c3\">include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_a3xgynthnks8-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Holding Jane Doe, John Doe&rsquo;s wife, hostage. The later section will highlight in greater detail ways to hold someone hostage. By sending a picture of Jane in a position of danger, John will feel intimidated, thus this is a successful instance of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Threatening to reveal the nature of John and Giles&rsquo; close relationship to Jane. Although Jane is no longer as infatuated as she used to be with John, this will still result in John feeling intimidated as he wonders how you gained this information, thus this is an example of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Leaving the remains of Jeremy at John&rsquo;s doorstep, ideally after 6:00 PM on a weekday, as if Jane were to see these remains when she returns home from work, she&rsquo;d dispose of them without any further questioning. This timing would be crucial to ensure that Jane does not interfere with the presence of Jeremy and that John will be able to see these remains. John will feel intimidated regardless, but it is also worth noting that this </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;attempt will be more effective if Jeremy&rsquo;s corpse is somehow preserved, so it is immediately apparent that the remains are that of Jeremy, and not any small rodent. </span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">2.3 Fear</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Ultimately, it is difficult to assuage whether an attempt of intimidation is successful without understanding the meaning of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>. This section will try to briefly establish the concept of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>, for the lucky few that are unfamiliar. Departing from the story of John Doe, some examples of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear </span><span class=\"c3\">include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_g10crlnefzgn-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>You return to your childhood home that you have lived in since you were born for spring break. College was the first time you were ever away from home this long, and you hope that this break is as rejuvenating as fall break was. However, you find that your parents often forget your name, and it takes multiple attempts for you to get their attention. When you do have their attention, the only expression you ever see on their faces is a wide grin which takes care to only expose a modest amount of pearly white teeth. When you are not in their immediate line of sight, they stand motionless, the same expression on their face. Every night, when your mother tucks you into bed and kisses you on the forehead, her clenched teeth pressing against your skin, you may feel </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Everyday that your parents leave for work, you feel </span><span class=\"c5\">relief</span><span>. However, on a sunny Wednesday afternoon, when you wake up and go through the motions of your morning routine, you realize that there is now an extra door leading from your bedroom, matching exactly that of the bathroom door. When curiosity gets the better of you, and you enter this new bathroom, only to find yourself reentering your bedroom from the normal bathroom door, you feel </span><span class=\"c5\">perplexed</span><span>. Then, when this extra door is nowhere to be found, and the door behind you shuts and locks the moment you are no longer in the doorframe, you may feel </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">. </span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">While you wander the unfamiliar new halls of your childhood home and your sense of time slips away, you notice how you don&rsquo;t recognize the smiling child in any of the childhood photographs your parents had so lovingly hung up throughout the house. The child&rsquo;s grin is far too wide, and despite you distinctly remembering having braces at that age, its teeth are pearly white. After descending the basement stairs to return to your bedroom on the second floor, you try the bathroom door once more to find it unlocked. As you reenter the bathroom, and look at yourself in the mirror. A wide grin can&rsquo;t help but stretch its way across your face with glee, as you have finally made it to the bathroom to begin your morning routine. The first step of your routine is to count the number of teeth you have. Identifying the emotion you feel as you do so is left as an exercise to the reader.</span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">3. The Strategy</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Regarding RPS as purely a game of chance results in a game with little strategy to be had. However, understanding the many psychosocial dynamics that are at play in society are key to determining a winning strategy for RPS. These strategies usually require some amount of knowledge about the person you are competing against, such as knowledge of their </span><span class=\"c5\">associates</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;(defined above), however, a general strategy is also included in case this knowledge is for whatever reason unobtainable. This paper will not go into detail as to how to obtain such information.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">3.1 A General Strategy</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">This strategy is to be used when very little information is known about your opponent, and it is difficult to procure any information. It will be assumed that the opponent is a blank slate.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Materials list:</span></p><ul class=\"c19 lst-kix_sbbmm0bc8uli-0 start\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">A weapon</span></li></ul><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Procedure:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">There are two possible cases, depending on whether or not your opponent is capable of feeling emotion and pain:</span></li></ol><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-1 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c11 c16 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">If this is the case:</span></li></ol><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-2 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">Boast about your flawless track record with games of RPS to your opponent. Regardless of whether this is true or not at the time of boasting, this raises the chances of instilling a sense of helplessness into your opponent. Otherwise, this has a chance of instilling a false sense of ease in your opponent if they assume that you are bluffing. Either result is advantageous.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span>Point your weapon towards the opponent. If your weapon of choice has high firepower or is a bludgeoning weapon, point this weapon towards this head, as in society, brain damage is undesirable, and the brain is located in the head. If your weapon deals damage by piercing or otherwise cutting into the flesh, hold your weapon at chest level, to maximize the amount of vulnerable locations you threaten to strike. Most people do not walk around in suits of armor. If for whatever reason, you do not have a weapon, any other form of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;can be substituted here.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span>Proclaim the </span><span>move</span><span>&nbsp;that you will make. Rock is recommended. If your opponent is exhibiting great amounts of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">, it may prove further advantageous to instruct your opponent what move to make. Figure 1 (below) highlights what instruction to give your opponent depending on the move you claim you will make.</span></li></ol><a id=\"t.f4a7d4a41e0c028031ab9f3d5ee1244c1cc39ccf\"></a><a id=\"t.0\"></a><table class=\"c10 c24\"><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Your move</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Opponent&rsquo;s move</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Rock</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Scissors</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Paper</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Rock</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Scissors</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Paper</span></p></td></tr></table><p class=\"c8 c10\"><span class=\"c12\">Figure 1: Matchups in RPS that result in your victory</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-2\" start=\"4\"><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">Begin the countdown, and when it comes time to do so, make the move that you claimed you will make in step (iii).

In spite of this, this strategy is considered ideal because it avoids the risk of your opponent overpowering you when you </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidate</span><span>&nbsp;them, as advance preparation for your </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span>&nbsp;method ensures that your opponent will be overcome with </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>, and will also be powerless in undermining your </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;at that immediate moment.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>The overall strategy follows the same steps as in 3.1, replacing step (ii) with a different intimidation method, focusing on an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span>&nbsp;of your choice.

Surviving in the dog-eat-dog world of RPS is a matter of becoming the intimidator, as opposed to the intimidated (the eating dog, as opposed to the eaten dog, if you will). Ignoring this reality can be considered reflective of the losing attitude many hold towards life. However, nothing is truly up to the Great Random. Taking the weaknesses of your fellow man in mind, victory will not be clean, but it will be in your hands.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Further research is recommended in understanding how to guarantee victory against those without emotions or fear of mortality, such as against computers. Considering growing fears in society regarding a robot takeover, discovering a weakness of computers in the game of RPS can then be translated to strategies to prevent the computer uprising. If computers are truly made in our image, then they will fall the same way we do. Our human hands can only hope for perfection, but everything will fall short, even our treacherous machines.</span></p>",

    "title": "Scotty Dog Cheating, Martha Is Speechless!",
    "body": "Once again, the cheating allegations cannot escape Scotty Dog who was seen leaving Schenley Park with Clifford the Big Red Dog in photos posted to X and Reddit by Paparazzi. However it seems these allegations are not just allegations as videos were taken of Clifford kissing Scotty Dog. Scotty Dog’s reaction also seemed to prove his guilt with him barking and charging at the camera to stop them from recording. \r\n**MARTHA IS OUTRAGED**\r\nConcerned fans began to tag Martha Speaks, Scotty’s current girlfriend, on the situation on X which caused her to say in a tweet that she was taking a break from social media. However, it is certain it is due to not wanting to post a hasty tweet on the current (or perhaps recently ended) relationship between her and Scotty Dog. We at README got an interview with Martha and were able to get a few questions in before she walked out and accused the reporter for being a “wannabe TMZ loser for the elderly” and “a stalker who cares too much about the love lives of dogs”. That’s mean of Martha to say because README is a very credible source of information and the reporter is not obsessed with dog romance. \r\nTOTAL CONFESSION\r\nIn a recent tweet published on Scotty Dog’s private X account, a red heart was posted which basically confirms cheating allegations because Clifford is red. Using trash left outside of Clifford’s home which included black dog hairs, Turner’s lemonade bottles and plaid wrapping paper, we at README have deduced that those two are certainly engaged in a secret love affair. But what reason did Scotty Dog have for cheating beside being a playboy?\r\n**THE UGLY TRUTH ABOUT SCOTTY DOG**\r\n While Martha was known for her red collar, she had actually switched to blue in recent years. Many fans suspect that this sudden relationship with Clifford is a stunt to bring more students to CMU. When Scotty Dog was dating Martha students felt the mismatching colors were off-putting for the CMU brand. Prospective students also thought the same thing and instead chose colleges where the couples matched the color scheme of the school. While blue is a color in the tartan, red is the distinctive CMU merchandising color. Since Clifford is red and CMU is red, this is a great relationship for Scotty Dog to get more students. As we know, the only thing Scotty Dog loves more than bagpipes, kilts, and Snoop Dogg is branding. That and charging outrageous amounts of money for tuition. \r\n**FUTURE**\r\nIt seems Scotty Dog’s love life is still so turbulent. In other news the reporter is no longer allowed to go back to the neighborhood Clifford lives in due to the neighborhood watch not appreciating investigative journalism. If you have any update PLEASE CONTACT README I’M BEGGING YOU. Go Tartans!",

    "body": "The quest to discover new superheavy elements has in the past been analogized to a race. Since the discovery of berkelium, in 1946, scientists from various laboratories around the world have competed, and at times collaborated, to discover new elements, leading to a string of discoveries of element 97 up to element 118. This race, however, has slowed to a halt after the most recent discovery, element 117, tennessine, in 2009. In 2017, the director of Riken, Dr. Hideto En’yo, not only announced that the search for element 119 had begun, but that elements 119 and 120 would be discovered within 5 years.\r\nDear reader, if you are capable of performing basic arithmetic mathematics, which I believe you are capable of since you are a university student, you might notice that 5 years after 2017 is the year 2022. Also, if you the reader have checked the date recently, you may notice that we are currently in the year 2024. That is, in fact, 2 years after 2022. Clearly, the current approach to discovering new elements isn’t working, and Dr. Hideto En’yo has been lying to us all.\r\nNow, dear reader, you might be wondering what exactly is the process of discovering new elements. In a nutshell (not literally), researchers take one heavy element, such as berkelium, and then accelerate particles of another element, such as calcium, to bombard the first heavy element (this was how tennessine was discovered). With enough tries, and luck, this might lead to the creation of a new element. Sounds simple enough, right? At this point, dear reader, you might be wondering how exactly they accelerate these particles. Magnets are used to both steer the particles in a circular trajectory and accelerate them up to speed. Herein lies the problem. Magnets? What do you mean they use magnets to accelerate particles? By magnets, you mean those things people put on their refrigerators? Like fridge magnets? This was never going to work, they have played us for absolute fools, managing to convince us, the common person, to put our faith in them. Obviously, this method would never work, and the particle physicists of our time do not know what they’re doing.\r\nIs all hope lost? Will we never discover element 119? Fortunately, I have not just brought to you, the reader, the problem, but also the solution to this very problem. If magnets can’t accelerate particles up to speed, what can? Evidently, a lot of things (try lifting the weights in the Cohon Fitness Center using fridge magnets, then lift that weight yourself). The best candidate for a viable method, however, are track athletes. Imagine for a moment two athletes, one holding a particle of einsteinium, element 99, and a particle of calcium, then have these two athletes sprint into each other at full speed. Not only would this finally allow the particles to move at sufficient speed, but it would ensure that the particles actually collide with each other, as two athletes colliding is much more probable than hoping two unimaginably tiny particles can be steered into each other using magnets.\r\nDear reader, we have plotted our course for the future. I have already sent my proposal to all of the scientists currently working on discovering element 119 (my editor has informed me that I have left out one scientist in particular, but I swear that was an accident). Dear reader, if you begin training now, you might just be able to become one of the athletes involved in the groundbreaking discovery of element 119. Another benefit that hasn’t yet been mentioned is that most likely, the new element would be named after an athlete, someone people care about, instead of some lousy so-called scientist. This of course means that if you train enough, you might be said athlete and receive naming rights. For reference, you would have to be able to run at speeds of 30 million meters per second, which admittedly is difficult but is fully within the realms of human possibility. Good luck, dear reader, and see you on the periodic table.",

Unless, of course, you buy the all inclusive package for 20% more plus shipping, in which case you can enjoy Carnegie Mellon from the comfort of your own home, 24/7, on up to three different devices! This place has a long and storied history, as one of the first institutions of higher learning on this side of the Appalachians. From the Fence, first constructed in 1917 to keep students from jumping into The Ravine, to the secret tunnels under Purnell that drama professors use to escape angry mobs, to the pre­finals scream all students participate in to convince their professors to curve, dear ol' Tech is a place with a good many traditions for you to engage in. And besides studying in Hunt, and studying in Sorrells, and studying in your dorm, and studying in bed, there is actually quite a bit to do here. I haven't even touched on all the good study rooms in the UC.\r\n\r\n\r\nReadme, of course, is excited to see you all here, and we really do wish the best in your time on this campus. While we do not, in any way, endorse fun, it's important to remember to prank all your professors once a semester ­ it's hard to get an A otherwise. CMU's a wonderful place, filled with wonderful people, and you'll make your government­mandated one (1) lifelong memory here in due time. The rest of it? Honestly pretty forgettable.\r\nWith all that aside, it's good to remember the three rules of college:\r\n\r\n\r\n 1) Don't increase the population\r\n\r\n 2) Don't decrease the population\r\n\r\n 3) Try not getting caught?\r\n\r\nWithout further ado, and with a warm welcome to hell itself...\r\n\r\n\r\n# *readme, volume #2, issue #0*",

We had the element of surprise.\r\nTwelve twenty­five p.m.\r\nPresident Jahanian, standing in\r\nNapoleonic fashion behind the frontline that had assembled atop Warner Hall, let his arm drop and gave the order. “Fire!”\r\nFour explosions, and four westbound cannonballs fired from Carnegie Mellon’s most archaic weapons, filled the air. Three made contact with the target, while one fell below the skyline, towards the streetscape, to wreak what minimal damage it could.\r\nThree shattered windows were visible against the silhouette of the Cathedral of Learning, with smoke billowing up out of the broken top. With Cathy out of commission, Carnegie Mellon was the grandest institution in Pittsburgh, but he didn’t have much time to admire his handiwork.\r\nHe donned his Napoleonic bowl cap. “Troops, advance!”\r\nThe chemistry majors tore down Forbes Avenue in pickup trucks, with vials of phosgene that they were ready to shatter once past Schenley Plaza. The physics majors set up their catapults, ready to bombard their western brethren with a deadly combination of textbooks and lab notebooks. The CS majors were sent to plant the virus they’d created on every piece of technology on campus; the biology majors went to sprinkle the virus they’d created onto the plates at every dining hall in the West. The ML majors were sent to figure out the optimal way to annex territory, bit by bit. And the Tepper students were sent in to negotiate a peace once victory was won, with the polisci majors sent in as backup once they failed.",

    "body": "As the laser cannon atop the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning nears completion, projected for the fall 2024 semester, Pitt students rejoice their opportunity to reenter the locked top floors of Cathy to zap unsuspecting cmu students. A Pitt alumn elaborated in an interview, “I always loved studying up there. The fear of death that comes from doing multidimensional calculus at that height—gusts of wind blowing your notes around, the ledge so perilously close to your study nook, pset deadline three minutes away and ticking down fast—it was really just an immense boost to my productivity. I haven’t been able to focus so well since I was an undergrad. But now I can visit my alma mater, finally get some work done, and zap some pretentious CMU students all in the same visit? I wouldn’t pass it up for the world.”\r\n\r\nLuckily for us, a recent email from the War Director at CMU states that Carnegie Mellon’s new Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics, replacing the now-demolished Skibo Gym, is on schedule to provide necessary shelter in the form of yet another turtle on campus. \r\n\r\n{{gates_turtle.png}}\r\n\r\nAs we all know, turtles have hard shells on their backs. Additionally, arbitrary cross sections of turtles' shells are smooth concave surfaces, and as such are suitable for deflecting lasers (see helpful graphic). The Director assures that the combined coverage of Wean, Gates, and the new Highmark Center will give CMU ample cover to remain safe under the watchful eye of Upitt's laser cannons constructing on top of the Cathedral.\r\n\r\n{{helpful_graphic.png}}",

A new policy has just entered into testing by the lab of Dr. Et Al, and has shown remarkable results in regards to student-professor relations. \r\n\r\nThis policy grants students the ability to assign an unrestricted amount of work to any professor at CMU, or in the state of Pennsylvania. This levels out the playing field by ensuring that professors can relate directly to the everyday struggle of students as they engage in the unending slog of CMU coursework. This practice will ensure that the bond between students and their instructors is tighter than previously seen, and as a labor history professor put it, “we are united in toil.”\r\n\r\n“Since the policy has entered into testing, I've assigned four different professors a compendium of League Of Legends Mechanics and Strategy guides. For the final this weekend we will be queuing as a 5-stack” \r\nRyan Chernoff, a School of Computer Science student at 5124 Margaret Morrison St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 who asked to remain “anonymous”, but to that we respond, “hi anonymous i’m dad”\r\n\r\n“It is so nice to be the one producing mediocre work instead of lazily skimming over students' work and rolling a 5d20 to determine their grade—as I have been doing for the past 17 years.”\r\nA CMU professor who works at CMU who asked for their CMU affiliation with CMU to remain anonymous\r\n\r\n“Fuck th*s shit, this is why I want to do research only.”\r\nDr. Et Al, the professor who is leading this very study",
