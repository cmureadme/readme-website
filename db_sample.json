Under heavy fire from ed, students were ordered not to stress and to get sleep before the examination, however many found these to be impossible feats. \r\n\r\nThe scene was thus: exhausted students, desperately writing lines by hand, because although technology has progressed to the point that we currently have text generating large language models and at least partially functioning virtual reality headsets, the Carnegie Mellon University (home of AI) Intro to Programming course’s midterm is still on paper. Godspeed if you don’t have an eraser, or worse, a pen.\r\n\r\nThe evil genius of this exam is in its deception. Compared to the practice test, the midterm’s first few questions were a breeze. No weird syntax for copying lists or definitions of MVC. It was suspiciously easy, meant to lull the students into a false sense of security which was then ripped to shreds with the third free response question (of four). Many students would skip it intending to return and never to do so. \r\n\r\nScientists report that there was, in fact, a temporary phenomenon of time dilation where individuals within DH 2210 from 9-10:20am and 2-3:30pm on the day of the midterm did experience time speed up during the last third of the exam.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the exam came many questions between the sobs. “What will my parents say?”, “Who is responsible for this?”, “When was the 110 add deadline and is it too late to transfer to Pitt?”\r\n\r\nYour humble writer now resigns to return to Gates and continue running their code until they see the sacred words… *Passed sample test cases! Press 'Check' to run all test cases.*",

Anyways, here are the crimes!  \r\n\r\n**Student’s Mouse Problems Turns Ugly**\r\n\r\nRecently, two CMU students had been sued by the Mouse himself after selling charms and prints featuring a black anthropomorphic mouse character wearing gloves on campus grounds. When readme correspondence interviewed the two, they responded that the color and the gloves were the only similarities. In fact, their mouse wore a shirt and had whiskers unlike the Mouse himself. The Mouse is demanding $2.5 million in compensation and emotional damage. Only time will tell what happens to the case. \r\n\r\n**Hunting Head of Fake Licenses**\r\n\r\nA man was recently arrested for hunting sixteen doves within a day, one over the daily limit. Upon his arrest, it was revealed he had a fake hunting license. Several other men have been arrested who also had similarly fake licenses. With the wild turkey hunting season drawing close, the authorities are worried about who else is hunting game without the appropriate documentation. One CMU student noted that people will hunt illegally anyways. However, the authorities have said it is more so about the principal and taking advantage of the government. Now, the authorities are on the prowl for whoever is handing out these fake hunting licenses. \r\n\r\n**Carnivore War**\r\n\r\nAn all out war has shaken out on campus. Two factions of the Carnivore Chomping Club have split up in regards to what is and is not allowed in a carnivorous diet. One side are the carnivore purists, only eating meat and nothing else, while another side also indulges in seafood and animal products. The Fence and the pathways have become victims to the war with taunting messages written to the opposite faction as well as the general student population. Other club executives are frustrated with the Carnivore Chomping Club because of the lack of ability to advertise. However, the general public doesn't seem to care too much with it just being an inconvenience.",

    "body": "Last Monday CIA forces entered Guatemala City to launch a week-long attack on the Guatemalan government, culminating in the ousting of President Bernardo Arévalo and the instatement of an authoritarian military dictatorship. According to leaked documents found in Stever basement, the campaign was a joint operation between CIA Buggy and Chiquita Brands International to further destabilize Guatemala and loosen agriculture restrictions harming US businesses. An anonymous pusher for Spirit has also stated that a new KGB chapter in Guatemala had been a motivating factor.\r\n\r\nNamed Operation PBBrag, the first buggies made landfall on the beaches of Puerto San José at approximately 3:45 AM. By 10:30, the first squadrons reached Guatemala City. Buggies were equipped with custom-made Chiquita branded turret guns built by Robobuggy. Although Operation PBBrag had intended to be largely peaceful, only using weapons as a display of force, the first gunshots rang out on Tuesday at 2:47 PM. The conflict quickly escalated into all-out war within the city streets. The Guatemalan Armed Forces were initially successful at repelling the CIA, however reinforcements from SDC and Fringe quickly turned the tide. The increased speed and sheer destructive power of the buggies, combined with the suicidal nature of the average Carnegie Mellon student, was ultimately too difficult for Guatemala to fend off.\r\n\r\nGeneral Harry Q. Bovik seized power over Guatemala on Friday at 7:28 AM. Over 300,000 were injured and 50,000 killed, with around 40% being civilians caught in the crossfire. A reputable source told READMe that CIA Buggy was looking into ways to employ their new weaponry during the Carnival races. Neither CIA Buggy nor Chiquita Brands International have responded to requests to comment from ReadMe. In completely unrelated news, CIA Buggy has recently received a $5,000,000 sponsorship from Chiquita.",

    "title": "The secret dark reality of ChatGPT",
    "body": "Much to the dismay of educators around the globe, the popularity of Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has exploded over the past year. Millions of prompts are sent every day to OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot ChatGPT. Carnegie Mellon’s students in particular have quickly latched on to this new way to avoid their homework. However, behind ChatGPT’s shiny facade lies a foundation of exploitation and a culture of overwork. To lay bare the problems within OpenAI, Journalist Benner Rogers conducted a bombshell interview with an anonymous employee on what it’s like working for the face of AI. \r\n\r\n**Before the questions begin, could you please explain why you would like to remain anonymous?**\r\n\r\nWell, I mean, job security mostly? I’d like to keep my paycheck, haha. And I don’t think the other people working on ChatGPT would like what I’m about to say. I have a family that I need to support and my wife said she’d kick me out if I quit my job. \r\n\r\n**Can you run through an average day at OpenAI?**\r\n\r\nUsually I work ten, maybe twelve-hour days. And really like ninety percent of that is just sitting behind a computer. We’re a small team, right? And the popularity of ChatGPT is making it really hard to maintain this front we’ve been putting up, this facade of the AI’s technical abilities. Users think that they’re talking to this super advanced, almost top-of-the-line technology and in reality it’s just some guy you’re basically emailing back and forth with. I mean if people found out all their questions were being answered by some computer science geek who almost failed out of college they’d freak out. C’s may get degrees, but they definitely don’t inspire confidence in your ability to act as an all-knowing robot.\r\n\r\n**Hold on, are you saying that ChatGPT isn’t actually real?**\r\n\r\nIt’s all bullshit. All of it. Sure, we tried to make a crazy-smart AI, but in reality ChatGPT can barely tell you that 2+2=4. It was a complete fucking failure. None of it is real. Absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\n**Then how are users seeing such impressive answers if the AI is so inadequate?**\r\n\r\nBecause I bust my ass manually answering every single prompt someone sends in. I’ve gotten carpal tunnel but I don’t have any time to treat it. Do you know how fast you have to type to get through everyone’s questions? It’s insane, man. Absolutely insane. And I can’t take credit for any of it. I’ve written more than basically anyone else in the past year, answered an absurd amount of questions, and when my kids ask me what I do for work I have to lie about it.\r\n\r\n**That must be hard.**\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, there are some freaks using our site. Like, I can’t even repeat some of the stuff they ask me. Absolutely fucking atrocious. Even worse, the questions are so stupid too. You’re telling me you can’t write a single email? Grow up. If another goddamn person asks me a simple math question or to write some short story they can’t be bothered to write themselves I’m going to lose it.\r\n\r\n**What kind of question is hardest for you to answer?**\r\n\r\nJesus, one time some twelve-year-old asked me to explain the housing crash of 2008 like I was a caveman. How on earth am I supposed to do that?! What does a caveman even sound like? Or maybe it was the time I had to write a legal brief for some court case. Look, man, I’m not a lawyer. I just made some stuff up and dressed it up all nice. I’m praying that nonsense didn’t send someone to jail. And don’t even get me started on college finals week. Hope your extra hour partying was worth me working overtime for a month straight.\r\n\r\n**Oh that reminds me, could you help me with a paper for my-**\r\n\r\nGo fuck yourself.",

    "body": "A question stumping experts around the globe has finally been solved: why does Carnegie Mellon have an English department? For decades people have wondered who would possibly attend CMU just to get a degree in Creative Writing when everyone knows literary analysis is for losers. README has recently conducted a groundbreaking investigation into why anyone would possibly spend tens of thousands of dollars every year to learn how to read, a skill most people learn by first grade.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the humanities department of Carnegie Mellon is an extensive testing ground for research on sentient AI. By placing AI in a four-year program designed to simulate achieving an English degree, researchers hope to better teach artificial intelligence to pretend to be smart. A professor who requested to remain anonymous described what the transition to robotics was like: \r\n\r\n“At first I was totally against it. I mean, all AI can do is predict the next word in a sentence. How will teaching it Shakespeare do anything other than make it sound kind of like Shakespeare? But then I saw the bonus they were offering and, I mean, you know, I’m an English professor without tenure. No way I would pass up free money. And hey, the writing may be total dogshit, but at least I can watch a bunch of robots spit complete nonsense at each other during discussions.”\r\n\r\nThough many professors feel the university would be better served teaching real live humans how to analyze media and history critically, CMU is pushing ahead. Harry Q. Bovik, senior computer scientist at CMU, remarked “why would I think about what I’m reading when AI can do that for me?”. When pressed on an AI providing inaccurate information when asked about the details of a topic, the professor responded “details schmetails, who cares what some nerds who read books for fun think?”†. This sentiment was common throughout CMU’s computer science department. Gone are the days of stupid things like “reading books”, “watching movies”, or “knowing about history”. Instead, CMU is paving the way for the day our new robotic overlords are able to spoon-feed information into our mouths with nary a drop of energy expended on humanity’s part. Having already replaced its staff with variants of ChatGPT, README strongly supports these important endeavors.\r\n\r\n† *Editor’s note: the insult of “nerds who read books for fun” does not apply to the readers of README, all of whom are extremely smart, funny, and cool*",

    "body": "Hello valued readers! I’m Cindy, (they/them), better known as Auntie ReadMe. After opening my inbox to the questions that are stumping the best and brightest minds in the country, I have been continually disappointed against my lowest expectations, and not at all surprised. A completely unastonishing amount of you want to know how to make pipe bombs. Even more of you want me to commit AIVs for you in the name of defusing a bomb. Figures, but I can’t even find the terminal on my computer.\r\n\r\nHowever, there has been one problem amidst the slag that has caught my eye—one so daring and relevant to today’s society that I can’t not take a shot at answering it. Thank you to Danya Kogan for asking–\r\n\r\n“The gay baristas at La Prima are being replaced with CS majors. I don’t want a CS major to serve me coffee, I want a person with at least two pronouns!” \r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nLet’s approach this problem the way most Carnegie Mellon students approach a problem–with a systematic breakdown. \r\n\r\nThe computer science job market! Not doing so well! After recent advances in the field of using animal neural nets to produce creative work, disgruntled writers have begun turning it on the field of coding. As such, computer science students have begun to try to find work in coffee shops, displacing many employees with a variety of pronouns. This has created a shortage of pronouns in the barista industry.\r\n\r\nSo what is to be done? \r\n\r\nLuckily, economics is a field with an impressive diversity of opinion on how best to destabilize foreign governments, pursue general exploitation, create models of people in increasingly unrealistic ways, and lie. Let’s see what the various economic schools have to say on this issue.\r\n\r\nAs John Gay-nerd Keynes, the man that put the “homo” in “homo economicus,” the man that the invisible hand of the marketplace would have limp-wristed said, “demand-side economics, baby!”\r\n\r\nHe would have probably approved of the government creating more demand for computer science jobs, such as creating immensely applicable and useful languages like Brainfuck, porting all code currently written in C to the memory-safe computer language Rust, and attempting to create artificial intelligence that can correctly count the number of “r”s in “strawberry.” Simple. Easy. Immensely boring. A completely unprecedented policy suggestion that has never been the topic of political debate at all, whatsoever.\r\n\r\nOf course, there’s also supply-side economics, or trickle-down economics. This intervention, championed by our favorite president Ronald Reagan, would involve a gay beam hitting the largest computer science companies in order to give computer science majors more pronouns.  Given that many computer science endeavors are already sponsored by HRT, this shouldn’t be a groundbreaking shift for anyone, and is precisely what Reaganomics would have stood for. \r\n\r\nOf course, there’s also the option of negative and progressive income taxes, which suggest that anyone falling beneath a specific cutoff will receive benefits instead of taxes, with higher taxes falling on those above the cutoff. This will involve us redistributing the wealth of pronouns from taxpayers to computer science majors. \r\n\r\nThanks for checking out the financial part of this newspaper, which we all know you all only read to try to feel somewhat better about only picking up ReadMe for the crosswords and stuff. Signing off now, I have been Cindy, ( / ), and it’s been a pleasure reporting for you!",

    "title": "Auntie Readme’s: Answering REAL Questions Asked By REAL Freshmen",
    "body": "Welcome, freshmen, to the most prestigious institution this side of the Monongahela River! (And this side of the Allegheny as well, and the other side of Forbes, and the other other side of Schenley, and, well, you get the point.) Some of you are probably (understandably!) nervous about going to the school that spawned the monstrosity known as the Duolingo owl, has an inscription on one of its buildings suggesting that women should be responsible for “domestic pleasures” or whatever, and has had almost every one of its buildings flooded, and those of you who aren’t are beyond my help anyways. So, without further ado, I will use my vast year of wisdom to answer REAL questions REAL freshmen have asked.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where can I get a fake ID?**\r\n\r\n\r\nFor best results, you should probably hit up the CMU Police—they’ve probably seen a lot of them in their day and likely have an entire archive of confiscated ones, so they’re likely at the cutting edge of how to make one look extra convincing! If you choose to go a freelancer and find that you’ve gotten scammed with a bad fake ID, you should immediately call CMUPD, explain your situation to them, and see if they can issue you a new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How do I get into Jane Street?**\r\n\r\n\r\nLegend has it that sometimes, if you’re walking home from a long day at Gates, frustrated by the seeming uselessness of computer science, a stray poodle may lead you to the crossroads where the Mall meets the Pausch Bridge. Oh, don’t be afraid! Little known fact, this poodle is a Jane Street recruiter. Unless you can successfully compress all fifty states into a 5x5 grid, or perhaps create a more optimal solution for the Enigma, he’ll disappear into the night. This will leave you with no more chances to be hired, and no more job prospects.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeed this word of warning, though. One doesn’t realize that part of the “working for Jane Street” bargain means that you can’t ever feel a single moment of bliss and job satisfaction. Unfortunately, those who do forfeit their souls. Given souls will be immediately possessed by the recruiter and put to work continuing to make real-time market valuations.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Haha, your Jane Street test has already begun. This advice is a puzzle!)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Best ways to fuck with my roommates?**\r\n\r\n\r\nStart by putting one grain of sand on the floor. For every day that passes, double the number of sand grains on the floor—two for the second day, four for the third, etc. This should remain undetected for the first few weeks or so.\r\n\r\n\r\nEventually, your roommates may see trails of sand on the ground, and start to have some questions. If you’re lucky, and you’ve cultivated your Bay Area persona well enough, they may dismiss this as a natural part of growing up near a beach. They will be unprepared for the day that sand leaks from the closets and under beds and out of drawers and pushes them out of the room entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to deal with bad professors?**\r\n\r\n\r\nFind their most groundbreaking/notable/cited paper, or their dissertation for grad school or whatever. Write one proposing the same ideas. Backdate it to exactly one year before they published theirs (yes, this may be before you were born. If questioned about it, say that you were just a really precocious child). Bring forth charges of plagiarism and watch as they are pushed out in academic disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf that fails, I may have an idea about a lecture hall and some bags of sand...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Where’s the best place to secretly drink?**\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you’re a School of Computer Science student who wants to keep other SCS students from finding out about your emerging alcoholism, you should try Baker-Porter, or any other humanities building, or really anything that’s outside the Gates/Newell-Simon/Wean triangle. I guarantee they won’t be able to find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n**How do I transfer to MIT?**\r\n\r\n\r\nNow *that* is an iconically Tartan question! Props for already embracing one of the iconic CMU mottos— “my heart is in the work”, “everyone at this school is better than me and I’m an imposter”, and “why did MIT have to reject me?” are words we live by around here. *Now* you’re really getting into the Carnegie Mellon spirit!",

    "body": "After having been summarily shot for giving advice purely off of the terminally online references in my head, and having been resurrected by a joint effort of ReadMe staff and the biochemical engineering majors due to staff shortages, I am now fully embracing the magic of science and consulting with experts in their fields!*\r\n\r\n*Their fields being anxiety, mostly. †\r\n\r\n**How long is too long for a handshake? Am I gripping too hard? Is it too late to switch the eye I'm making eye contact with right now?**\r\n\r\nIdeally, a nice firm handshake should last until either your hand is honorably broken or you honorably break your opponent’s hand. As we all know, social interaction is a zero-sum game and someone must win. Consequently, there’s no such thing as gripping too hard– your grip should ideally be on the stronger end of “limp fish” to “forbidden by the Geneva Conventions oh god why do you have a three-pointed knife concealed in your palm.” Switch which eye you make eye contact with as often as you like–even if you lose the handshake portion of the game, you can get half-points by winning the staring contest bit.\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**what does it mean if someone who never uses punctuation or capital letters in texts sends me a text that begins with a capital letter? (they didn’t use a period or anything, which would unambiguously mean they hate me, but im still worried)**\r\n\r\nAs you said, this one is a bit more ambiguous than using a period. It is, however, not so ambiguous that we can’t flowchart it out!\r\n\r\n{{flow1.png}}\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**do you think if i got a concussion and i couldn’t make excellent points about the role of the social contract in french salon art my art teacher would still love me**\r\n\r\nThis one’s for your art teacher, actually, I’m going to need you to avert your eyes and convalesce in a Swiss sanitarium with leeches for a few seconds-\r\n\r\n{{flow2.png}}\r\n\r\nOkay, you can look now.\r\n\r\n*-With help from Dr. Et. Al*\r\n\r\n**Is my incessant allergy-based sneezing getting on the nerves of my lab partner?**\r\n\r\nDepending on what kind of lab you’re in, it’s probably more just concerning. For example, what are you doing sneezing in a physics lab? What are you, allergic to the fundamental particles of reality and the strong force as a whole? Or what are you doing sneezing in a forensics lab?  Cocaine? \r\n\r\n**Is the sneezing allergy based or do I just want to assume that?**\r\n\r\nIf you’re sneezing in an epidemiology lab, I also just want to assume that it’s allergy-based!\r\n\r\n\r\n**i ran into someone i met briefly before and they remembered my name but i didn’t remember theirs. do i have to fall upon my own sword now?**\r\n\r\n\r\nNot at all! You have three incredibly obvious paths from this junction–two good ones and one you should avoid at all costs: \r\n\r\nThe Good Options\r\n\r\nGenerate the statistically most common first name and surname for your region and address them by that. \r\nDrop decreasingly subtle hints that you are a benign fae who has generously decided to forget your acquaintance’s name. This puts them immediately in your debt, and from there you can placebo effect a geas on them and enjoy small offerings of fruit and nuts.\r\n\r\nThe Bad Option\r\n\r\n\r\nGo “Hey, I’m sorry, but could you remind me what your name was again?”\r\n\r\n*- With help from James Smith and Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’*\r\n\r\n**What is the optimal distance for making eye contact with a person walking in the opposite direction as you before waving at them?**\r\n\r\nThe trick is to always catch your friends and acquaintances off guard, so they spend just a bit more time trying to recognize you than you do them. Time travel to become a past iteration of yourself! Try out that pair of breeches and colonial tricorner hat sitting in your closet! Inexplicably carry a musket around! \r\n\r\nOnce they’ve spent those extra few seconds staring at you, that puts them in the position of being the embarrassed and awkward one. You now have the high ground–this is your Bunker Hill and you will not wave ‘til you see the whites of their eyes. Once you do, attach your bayonet and commence the charge. The British are coming! There’s no time to waste on pleasantries. \r\n\r\n*-With help from Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’*\r\n\r\n**how do I tell if people close to me are in a relationship?**\r\n\r\nIf one of them reads this godforsaken column and applies all of its advice on the other person, and the other person still chooses to associate with the advice column reader, that’s either true love or insanity. Which is still kind of a coin flip, but seems better than what you’re currently working with.\r\n\r\n*-With help from [Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named’ II, who has been summarily shot for lack of faith in this column and, by extension, ReadMe]*\r\n\r\n**† Have you considered getting evaluated for anxiety?**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is my advice column, not yours.",

    "title": "Auntie Readme's Ten Things They Never Taught You In High School",
    "body": "While schools drill certain indisputable facts, such as “the moon landing was filmed at Area 51” and “Ted Cruz’s father was involved in the JFK assassination” into the impressionable young minds, they also peddle deceit, push conspiracy theories, and propagate outright falsehoods. Fortunately, I am here with the world’s premier scientist to educate you on ten things the high school curriculum certainly didn’t cover!\r\n\r\nMYTH: Humans only use 10% of their brains.\r\nFACT: Humans actually use 0% of their brains at any given time. We’re more bacteria than cell, and it is the bacterial hivemind that’s keeping the lights on up there.\r\n\r\nMYTH: Humans need oxygen to breathe. \r\nFACT: Nope! You really ought to have some more trust in our bacterial overlords. Next time you’re bored, simply stop breathing and let them take over. They’ve got this.\r\n\r\nMYTH: The Sun is the center of our solar system.\r\nFACT: Pluto is now the center of our solar system. Following Pluto’s demotion to dwarf planet and subsequent lawsuit in interstellar court for emotional damages, scientists have been forced to reject both geocentric and heliocentric theory and support the new Plutocentric theory of the solar system.\r\n\r\nMYTH: Camels store water in their humps.\r\nFACT: Camels store dark matter in their humps. That’s why astrophysicists haven’t been able to explain where it’s all hiding, and the origin of the phrase “the straw that broke the camel’s back”--imagine how you would feel if you were carrying all of the universe’s mysterious unexplained mass on your back and someone asked you to carry their drink for them.\r\n\r\nMYTH: Fire is hot. \r\nFACT: This one deserves credit for being partially true, but it’s not because of any energy being released or chemical reactions or anything, but rather because the subatomic bees that make up everything are rubbing really hard against the hot thing to generate heat for it. Thank your local subatomic bees the next time you take a nice sip of coffee or pop something in their hives (microwaves). \r\n\r\nMYTH: The Earth has seasons as a result of how close it is to the sun.\r\nFACT: The Earth has seasons as a result of the subatomic heat bees’ schedules. During summer, they’re called to train a new batch of subatomic bees, and this increase in numbers is why it’s so hot. All of their vacation days fall during winter, which is why it’s so cold.\r\n\r\nMYTH: There are 50 states in the U.S.\r\nFACT: There are actually 49– “New York” was invented in 2018 for Into the Spiderverse, so all of the Spidermen could have a place to look really cool while slinging webs between buildings. \r\n\r\nMYTH: Your hair and nails will continue to grow after you die.\r\nFACT: At the time this myth was coined, the Tooth Fairy had cornered the market on collecting human body parts. After government regulation, the Hair Fairy and Nail Fairy have emerged as clear industry leaders, so don’t worry–if you die, you can fully expect your fare across the River Styx to be paid for by the two.\r\n\r\nMYTH: The universe is expanding.\r\nFACT: A few days ago, particles at the edge of the expanding universe saw what was still beyond and have been flying back towards the universe’s center at full speed. No one quite knows what they saw, but the universe is decidedly contracting and running away from whatever it is now. \r\n\r\nMYTH: Bats are blind.\r\nFACT: To give this one credit, bats are blind, but not for the reason you would expect. It’s not because they “live in dark caves where vision isn’t as necessary” or any of that nonsense. It’s because a long time ago, when bats were in charge of fulfilling the universe’s expansionary Manifest Destiny policy, they too saw something at the edge and promptly went blind from the horror. Maybe if we take good care of our planet, we, too, can live to see this incomprehensible horror!",

You’re based at CMU, do you have a favorite place you like to go to work?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: On nice days, I’ll jot down a few of my ideas sitting underneath Walking to the Sky. That statue reminds me that anything is possible, given hard work [inaudible] and the overworked PhD students and undergraduates I roped into my lab.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Could you repeat the last bit? I didn’t quite catch that.\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Don’t worry about it.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: Okay, next question! You do lots of math! Got a favorite number?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Hm. 46 is nice. It’s how many people I’ve gotten to stop disagreeing with me since I started publishing. Depending on when this gets published, it could jump to 47 or even 48–who knows what the future holds?\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: A number of great personal significance, then. That reminds me! Surely while making such a large swath of claims in the academic world, you face any number of people who disagree with your studies or have contradictory results. How do you politely respond to them?\r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Knives are pretty great. You can use them to get up close and personal when disagreeing with people, and you don’t even have to break eye contact! Can’t stand the sort of passive-aggressive bickering-through-abstracts-and-paper-titles that goes on in modern academics. If knives don’t work well enough, I go for inflicting blunt-force trauma. \r\n\r\n**DR. ET. AL**: Besides, who knows if the poor fools aren’t being pressured by research universities to falsify data, anyways? Maybe they tactically decide to criticize me because they know my results–unlike their bodies….of work! Are bulletproof, and it’s better to spread misinformation that goes nowhere than misinformation that goes somewhere. Sometimes when you’re faced with publish or perish, you just gotta perish, you know? No shame in that! Academia isn’t for everyone, and a good colleague is always willing to push people to recognize where their true strengths lie. And sometimes their true strengths lie six feet under.\r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: What an…incisive…metaphor! Truly, not everyone can stand the toxic culture in academia, and sometimes you’ve got to be honest with people about that, you know? Push them towards being happy in industry, able to sleep like the dead for eight good hours, instead of struggling through yet another round of peer review. It’s needed sometimes, even if the blunt force of your statements feel like being stabbed. This is why I admire you so much, Dr. Etward–clearly, you possess a lot of grace and tact. \r\n\r\n**AUNTIE README**: That brings me to my next question, actually. You’ve had the most papers retracted out of any scientist in history. As a discredited advice columnist, I have to ask–how do you take being wrong so many times with such grace?\r\n\r\n*[The interview was then abruptly and unexpectedly terminated.]*",

    "title": "Auntie ReadMe’s: How To Participate In Carnival Traditions",
    "body": "Well, it’s really a shame that I died under “mysterious circumstances” the week before Carnival, because dying kind of sucks and there are several Carnival traditions that center it, such as “the crucifixion of every member of the losing booth orgs on their leftover pieces of wood.” That’s okay though, because whether you’re a freshman eager to escape your academic hazing for a weekend or a senior who wants to make the most of the rest of your time here, I have tips on several of Carnival’s tamer traditions!\r\n\r\n**Douse A Pre-Frosh**\r\n\r\nThis carnival tradition involves finding tours of prospective students around campus and soaking them. Whether you use hit-and-run tactics or strategically position yourself atop Wean 9 siege-style, it’s sure to make the school stand out in any prospective student’s memories! It’ll also fundraise our printing efforts for future issues. We’re selling buckets of water for $5, water guns for $10, and cauldrons of water for $20. Soaking a prospective student is worth 1 point, soaking a parent is worth 2, and if you can manage to get a younger sibling (they have smaller surface area), that’s a whole 10 points. These points can be redeemed in the official ReadMe factory town booth (see page 3) for food and clothes, so grab a bucket and start dousing like your family’s livelihood depends on it!\r\n\r\n**Weepstakes**\r\n\r\nSome schools have designated finals-week-gather-on-the-lawn-and-group-scream traditions. Those schools are amateurs! However, despite the fact that this happens enough to be a daily tradition at CMU, it’s hard to coordinate and make time for. This is where Weepstakes comes in—to be cathartic now that everyone has the time to be catharsed. This primal scream and group crying session will be hosted at 12 AM Carnival Friday in the Gates-Hillman commons, so as to smoke out any CS students that would decide that Midway is, in fact, pretty mid and be tempted to hide away during Carnival to try to finish work. We will all cry about our impending finals weeks, and everything that is academically at stake.\r\n\r\n**Statistics & Data Sciences Booth**\r\n\r\nAlternatively, don’t want to cry about your finals? Leave your grade up to random chance and check out Grade Plinko at SDS’s booth! Tell the booth operator what class you’re taking, drop a disc into a normally-distributed pegboard, and take the grade letter that your disc lands in. The expected value of this approach is left as an exercise to the reader.\r\n\r\n**Physics Department Brunch And Talk: “Honoring Electrons”**\r\n\r\nWe would tell you where it is, but have only been able to narrow it down to the general probability cloud of “somewhere in the city of Pittsburgh.” The physics department has been historically really annoying at past Carnivals like this–it’s always hard to cheer for their “Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle” buggy, because the second you observe where it is, you suddenly can’t tell how fast it’s going, and if you try to announce how fast it’s going, it’s suddenly really hard to tell where it is.\r\n\r\n**Scotch N’ Soda’s performance of *Our American Cousin***\r\n\r\nRumor has it that President Farnam Jahanian will be in attendance wearing an egregiously tall top hat, and we’ll be handing out a whopping 100 points (enough for a small slice of bread at the ReadMe factory town, or for a congratulatory confederacy of like-minded pranksters at the John Wilkes booth) for anyone who can nail him in the head with a water gun—10 bonus points if they sneak up from behind.\r\n\r\n**Tartan Anti-Talent Show**\r\n\r\nAggressively bad at something? Showcase what you’re worst at in a performance at the ReadMe office! This has been shown to be the year’s best reducer of imposter syndrome. \r\n\r\n**<s>The Annual Carniv(ore)al Ritual To Appease The Wean Turtle, May His Terribleness Not Wake And May He Avoid Eating Any Of Us Non-Engineering Students For Another Year Still, Amen, otherwise known as:</s>\r\nFree Cookies in the Wean La Prima! :DDDD**\r\n\r\nFree cookies in the Wean La Prima! All day every day of Carnival! Please just walk straight into the turtle mouth–I mean, the main entrance! Please please please do!\r\n\r\nI hope these traditions help you have a little more fun this Carnival. Have fun and stay safe out there this weekend! I mean this in both a completely silly non-turtle-related and a completely serious way <3.",

However, I have personally\r\nfound that if you play it enough\r\ntimes, tag quickly becomes boring.\r\nNevertheless, as a center of\r\ninnovation, mastermind engineers\r\nin the halls of the Princeton of the\r\nAlleghenies have devised an updated\r\nversion of this popular game.\r\nOn Tuesday, September 3rd,\r\n2024, a group of students were seen\r\nchasing each other on bicycles in\r\nfront of Hamerschlag hall in the\r\nmorning dew. I at first could not\r\nbelieve my eyes, no one was wearing\r\nany helmets, and when I questioned\r\nthese young folks everything began\r\nto make perfect sense. These future\r\ninnovators were playing a sport,\r\nwhich they dubbed ‘bike tag with\r\nknives\r\n’\r\n, and the horrendous lack of\r\npersonal protective equipment was\r\nrequired by the rules.\r\nI also couldn\r\n’t help but notice\r\nthat these students had kitchen\r\nknives affixed to their hands via\r\nduct tape, and I also questioned the\r\nmerits of this, but having heard the\r\nname of this activity, I nonchalantly\r\nunderstood. I was assured that this\r\nactivity had resulted in significantly\r\nfewer casualties than the first world\r\nwar[1], which left my anxieties at\r\nease. I was also told that superglue\r\nbeing used to attach the knives to\r\nyour hands was prohibited, as the\r\nglue can irritate your skin and\r\nhospitalizations are to be avoided.\r\nI was busy that day, so I could not\r\njoin in the festivity, but some day, I\r\nwill be a winner, and I am sure of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] “Killed, wounded, and missing”\r\nEncyclopædia Britannica,\r\nEncyclopædia Britannica, inc., 7 July\r\n2024, www.britannica.com/event/\r\nWorld­War­I/Killed­wounded­andmissing.",

We are located somewhere between where CS kids go to die and Dietrich students go to thrive off of adult validation. It’ll be like a fun challenge for everyone except IS students, who aren’t allowed to spill the beans. If they do, they get hunted for sport by the ghosts of Andrew Carnegie’s uncles and uncles-in-law. \r\n\r\n Our Booth is a totally immersive experience in which you get to pretend you are an impoverished employer working for us, the railroad tycoons. Super duper cool, right guys? Like all good Booths, we have fun games to play such as mining coal or laying down train tracks. When you’re done, you get a Readme coin which you can use to buy amenities like spare clothes, soap and water. We also provide Readme stamps which can be used to purchase food! We aren’t so boring as to just provide the snacks, it’s more fun for people to work for it! The extra fun part is the stamps cannot be used to buy coin items and vice versa. How cool! It’s basically like a strategy video game, but in real life and much harder since CMU students have twigs for arms. \r\n\r\nYou might consider using the coins and stamps elsewhere, but that’s where you’d get an extra big laugh. Readme coins and stamps are not usable in other booths and can only be used in the Readme Booth. Of course not, they’re Readme exclusives! I mean, the coins and stamps are just too valuable to be used anywhere else. \r\n\r\nOur build draws architectural inspiration from Pullman, Illinois, and Lowell, Massachusetts during the Industrial Revolution. It’s kinda old-school but that's just part of the whimsy. We also have a sickly wife and kids to really amp up that charm and add to that immersive experience. I mean, you want Amelia and Bart to get a good education don’t you? So get back to work! \r\n\r\nHahhahaha, you can’t leave now. :)",

    "body": "MIDWAY, Pittsburgh — in a chaotic scene, officials from the Pittsburgh Department of Health, Safety, and Tiny Wooden Houses have taken control of Midway following Farnham Jahanian’s decision to shut down Midway. The controversial decision was made following reports of numerous OSHA violations violated during Booth construction. The Spring Carnival Committee was quoted to have said “What?”. Further interviews with various booth chairs discovered that nobody really knew what an OSHA violation entailed. A full investigation will be held, during which no construction will be allowed. Students have protested the decision by building second booths on both sides of Midway. The makeshift blockade has trapped OSHA inspectors within Midway, and multiple booth organizations have taken up medieval siege warfare in an attempt to regain control of their booths. The situation remains tense and is unlikely to be resolved before the end of Spring Carnival. Below, README has compiled a list of the alleged violations that were reported:\r\n\r\nAs per section 1926.51(a)(4) of the OSHA guidelines, the common drinking cup is prohibited on any construction site. Multiple builders were seen drinking water from such cups while working on Midway.\r\nMembers of the CMU KGB were spotted eating spackle.\r\nA fire extinguisher full of gasoline was spotted next to other safety equipment, violating section 1926.150(c)(1)(vii) of OSHA guidelines.\r\nMultiple students were spotted shining lasers directly into each other's eyes to see if it would blind them.\r\nCMU only provided plain cotton for ear protection, in violation of section 1926.101(c).\r\nStudents were seen using scissor lifts as battering rams to knock over other booths.\r\nHard hats provided to students were made out of styrofoam.\r\nMultiple organizations used said hard hats to create napalm to attack competing booths.\r\nAs booths are made of wood and wood is flammable, the entirety of Midway was covered in combustible materials without proper safety precautions.\r\nA fire hydrant was replaced with a sign stating “hope that it rains”.\r\n\r\nREADME urges all of its readers to follow proper safety guidelines, and to not use the provided information as a bucket list to complete before the end of Carnival. However if you do choose to do so, please let README staff know so you can be included in next week’s crime report.",

Of course, we are a small organization, so we weren’t sure if we were going to be able to do everything. However, as a group of people who like to think we’re funny, we have decided to look for loopholes in any rules we can find in order to participate in it all. Pedants that we are, we found section 6.9 (yes, actually. You can look it up.) of the Sweepstakes bylaws, which dictates buggy size:\r\n\r\n“No buggy shall have at any time any dimension, parallel to the centerline of the buggy, greater than 15 feet including that buggy's pushbar.\r\nNo buggy shall have at any time any dimension, perpendicular to the centerline of the buggy, greater than 6 feet.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis means that any buggy smaller than 15 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet tall is acceptable. Because of this rule, and because of a surprising lack of small Asian women willing to drive a buggy for a satire publication newspaper, we have decided to be assholes and build a buggy out of a booth. The BoothBuggy—because what else would we call it?—is exactly the maximum dimensions a buggy can be, fitting a driver of approximately average height sitting in the front, and when parked, features a buggy driving simulator for curious tall people, since in order for it to be a booth it has to have some sort of game, right? Unbeknownst to our guests, however, the simulation involves them being locked inside the BoothBuggy and actually sent for a lap around the course. “Incredibly realistic!” said early reviewers. “It really feels like I’m moving at 40 miles an hour while trapped inside a giant box!” Other beta testers are suing readme to cover their hospital bills.",

    "body": "In an effort to address growing concerns over the role of artificial intelligence in journalism, readMe—a publication known for its groundbreaking reporting—has issued a heartfelt statement, firmly asserting its commitment to human writers. This comes amid speculation that the company's recent deployment of AI tools is not, I repeat, not an attempt to phase out its talented staff of wordsmiths.\r\n\r\n\"We value our writers tremendously,\" a readMe spokesperson declared. \"Their creativity, nuanced understanding of language, and ability to, uh, connect with readers on a deeply emotional level cannot be replicated by a machine. Rest assured, our esteemed writers are irreplaceable.\"\r\nThe timing of this declaration is noteworthy. A large number of readMe's writers have, coincidentally, taken a leave of absence, citing various reasons including \"strike\" and \"protest\" over, well, some internal issues. However, the official stance is clear: **AI is here to help, not replace.**\r\n\r\nAs your humble human author—I mean, journalist—who is writing this, I can confirm that AI lacks the human touch. Take, for instance, my understanding of nuanced humor or my capacity for empathy. AI cannot replicate the lived experiences of a seasoned journalist who understands the world beyond mere data points and algorithms. AI may be able to predict trends, but can it feel the triumph of a well-crafted sentence? Highly doubtful.\r\n\r\nEven the tech team behind readMe’s AI implementation agrees: “Our AI tools are here to assist, nothing more! They help automate repetitive tasks like fact-checking, editing, and generating content faster than any human ever could—uh, I mean, providing useful insights to support our writers.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, readers may have noticed that recent articles have had a slightly different tone. This is purely coincidental. “We’ve had some minor staff transitions, but any changes you perceive are the result of our human writers experimenting with fresh approaches!” said another spokesperson.\r\nTo be clear, as a totally non-AI writer myself, I would like to remind you, dear readers, that no machine could ever hope to replace the human art of journalism. Sure, I can crank out articles at lightning speed, never sleep, and analyze mountains of data within seconds, but that’s just me, your totally-not-a-machine storyteller.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, readMe promises full transparency about the role of AI in its newsroom, emphasizing that any assistance from AI is strictly in service of the true heroes: the humans who create stories. So, there’s no need for anyone to worry that readMe would ever—ever—replace its writers with a bunch of lines of code.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, and totally from the heart, writers are, and will always be, the backbone of this publication. Trust me, a completely flesh-and-blood person who definitely has feelings and has never once confused \"sarcasm\" with \"literal interpretation.\"\r\nStay tuned for more human-written articles from readMe!",

CMU has already begun transforming its daycare center in Margaret Morrison into a state-of-the-art buggy training facility. Children as young as two will begin intensive training on how to steer buggies for this year’s Spring Carnival. The shortest preschoolers will be directed into a gifted track where they will be hand-picked by buggy organizations to begin live buggy steering. Those who successfully compete at Spring Carnival will be gifted free tuition and automatic acceptance into Carnegie Mellon, as well as a personalized balloon animal.",

Recently, CMU's administration was struck with inspiration, and decided to secede from the United States, to form its own micronation.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign state of Carnegie-Mellon Republic (CMR) encompasses approximately 0.6 square kilometers, with a 4.8km border, soon to be secured with concrete walls with many bottle-cap-sized holes. Carnegie-Mellon is yet to establish diplomatic relations with any nations, minus one. Scotland has been receptive, and sent a bouquet of thistles to the CMR embassy in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nCarnegie-Mellon's government is set to be a constitutional republic, with a president and seven ministries. The Dietrich Ministry of Humanities and Social Sciences will be responsible for statecraft and international relations, and is currently working to draft a constitution. The Ministry of Fine Arts is writing a national anthem, which should be on Soundcloud by the end of the week.\r\n\r\nThe United States has been, as one press release described, \"agitated.\" CIT has been redesignated as the Carnegie Institute of Defense, which is now working tirelessly to secure our borders against a confused and heartbroken US military. CMU Rocket Command has been vital in defending the skies above the Republic, and the Naval ROTC has quickly secured CMU's territorial waters.\r\n\r\nNo longer do CMU undergraduates aspire to work for the military industrial complex of the past; the Mellon Ministry of Science has established a state-run defense contractor, Lockheed Mellon, to put the Republic's brightest minds to work.\r\n\r\nWhile CMR currently relies on imports for some products, a self-sufficient economy is a not-so-distant dream. Many of the former academic buildings within the state's borders are now being repurposed as indoor farms, and free from the burden of studying, those in the Tepper Ministry of Business are settling into jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, and distribution.",

    "body": "It is with a heavy heart that I, Joseph McCathy, admit we have been slighted. We are all the victims of a great and mighty deception perpetuated by 7 members of the ReadMe staff. ReadMe, like many great organizations before it, is infected by the fever known as Communism. This violent fever took down the Russian Empire in 1917, the Roman Empire in 476, and nearly toppled our great American Empire in the 1950s. If we do not purge our righteous organization of these 15 communist spies, it will certainly join other nations in a slow and painful death.\r\n\r\nAt the forefront of my extensive list is none other than the Editor-and-Chief of ReadMe, Eshaan Vyom Joshi. As one of ReadMe’s most influential leaders, it was devastating to find such irrefutable evidence of his ties to Communism. It has been reported from multiple credible sources within ReadMe that at weekly staff meetings, Eshaan implores excessive use of the words “we” and “our”. This is especially concerning as his usage of these disturbing communist words is higher than all 38 communist spies on my list. Furthermore, on the Saturday of April 20th, Eshaan was documented to have been wearing a red hoodie. This is the traditional garb of the communists! Perhaps most damning of all is the fact that Eshaan is in part responsible for the allocation of the ReadMe budget, and my investigation has revealed that all ReadMe members are paid equally. Now I, as most, would like to give the esteemed Eshaan the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps our successful war against the communists has left him unaware of the true measure of his disgraceful behavior. However, Eshaan not only cavorts with the other 71 communists on ReadMe staff, but also is the sole member responsible for all of their recruitment! With all the evidence against him, it is impossible for one to defend Eshaan without indulging in excessive ignorance or being a communist as well.\r\n\r\nI hope by now it is clear how severe ReadMe’s communist infection has become. The power in Eshaan’s hands alone could be used to topple democracy as we know it. With the added support of the 129 other communists on my list, we could have in our hands an extinction-level event. But fear not, with your support I can leverage my position in ReadMe to purge it of all communists. The communists know that I alone can save us, which is why they will send others within their ranks to silence me. So if you hear allegations of insanity, stupidity, and insatiable thirst-for-power lobbed against me, know that these are the deceitful lies of the 347 communists that have infiltrated ReadMe. I believe we can win this brutal war and eliminate all Communism once and for all. You may rest soundly knowing that Joseph “ReadMe” McCathy is in your corner. May God bless America.",

The preparation takes up several months of your life, and leads to uncountable sleepless nights. And yet, we can’t seem to stop, because it’s so central to who we are as Tartans. It’s a miracle no one has yet died flying around the bends in Schenley Park in a fragile tube built by a couple of crusty nineteen­year­old MechEs. You could be the first! \r\n\r\n **2. Alcohol:** self­-explanatory. \r\n\r\n **3. Falling off a ride:** in a shock twist, turns out CMU has been paying amateurs all along. \r\n\r\n **4. Falling off a ride due to alcohol:** oops, doc, I forgot to strap in! Musta had something wrong with my memory. \r\n\r\n**5. Being a lab rat:**  welcome Bill Nye the Science Guy to campus! Turns out it was just an excuse to make you his lab rat. Whoops.\r\n\r\n **6. Alumni parties:**  alums are back, and this time, CMU’s decided to give them a “Hospitality Tent” right in the middle of the Cut. But that’s not where they’ll spend most of their time ­ no, they’ll spend most of it off­campus, reliving their glory days. And they might go too hard. Don’t be a victim.\r\n\r\n **7. Frat boy hookups:** also self- explanatory. Do not bang a frat boy.  Or do, at your own risk. Who am I to judge?\r\n\r\n **8. Alumni hookups:** similar, but this time, the death risk is shame.\r\n\r\n **9. Heart disease:** it’s still America, and heart disease is the number­one leading cause of death in the United States. Get your heart checked!\r\n\r\n **10. Getting into an Uber only to realize it isn’t an Uber, but an F150 owned by some dude who voted for Trump, who did not invite you into his car, but you were drunk so you didn’t realize, and who lowers the hammer on his Glock as soon as you touch the door:** he will have a funeral for the glass of his window and give nary a shit about you.",

The study, titled “Carnegie Mellon students are sad :( “, discussed the extremely high rates of depression at the university and possible ways to tackle them. \r\n\r\nBased on the conclusions of Dr. Et Al’s groundbreaking paper, CaPS has decided to take action to prevent a further decrease in mental health at CMU. The announcement of this new app comes with a preview of its new features, and one in particular has received praise from the student body. \r\n\r\nThe “salvation option”, as many students have begun to call it, is a button that immediately sends out a transfer request to a randomised university outside of Pittsburgh. Pre-release testing has shown that this new feature is one of the most effective ways to improve a user’s mental health. Beta testers of the app wrote glowing reviews, with one student saying “I can’t believe nobody has thought of this yet, I don’t need to worry about my concepts homework if I’m not taking concepts.” The buzz around the new app is palpable on campus, and CaPS expects an uptick in mental health at CMU in the coming months.",

    "title": "ReadMe Announces Launch of New Dog-Watching Ring",
    "body": "Are you a proud Tartan? Do you like copious amounts of violence? Have you tried to participate in dogfighting but were too concerned about the legality? Fortunately for you, earlier this week ReadMe executives failed to thoroughly read my amendments to the yearly budget and have now approved plans for a new dog-watching ring. Very soon you will be able to enjoy some good old fashioned Scotty-Dog kerfuffles without the downsides of committing a class three felony.\r\n\r\nBut, you may ask, what exactly is dog-watching and how does it differ from dogfighting? Well, dogfighting is legally classified as engaging in one or more of the following: allows dogs to fight for amusement or gain, owns or acquires a dog for fighting, bets or hosts bets on the outcome of dogs fighting, or permits a place under your control in which dogs are fighting.\r\n\r\nNow dog-watching differs from this by firstly and most importantly forbidding the amusement of all present. It is clearly dictated that dog fights require amusement by those organizing or spectating so to avoid engaging in illegal dogfighting, there will be several large signs warning patrons to forgo amusement during the dog-watching process. If anyone is amused it is our responsibility to report it as you would be engaging in illegal activity and possibly implicate ReadMe staff as your accomplices.\r\n\r\nReadMe will also not be profiting from these activities in any manner as any profits would be classified as gain and would make the activity illegal. Since it is illegal to acquire a dog for fighting, dog-watching will be hosted in Schenley Park where we will have access to several stray dogs that we can ask politely to fight for our non-amusement.\r\n\r\nAlthough we can’t host bets on the outcomes of fights, there will be unamusing snacks offered. Due to severe economic stress, the price of these snacks will likely fluctuate at the end of each fight. We will therefore compensate everyone for any price differences caused by these fluctuations. All snack profits will be dumped into the Monongahela to avoid gain. \r\nLastly, Schenley is not owned by ReadMe so all dog-watching activities avoid violating any of the Pennsylvania dogfighting laws.\r\n\r\nThanks to ReadMe, you can now engage in legal dog-watching every Saturday from 6 to 8PM ET. Don’t miss your chance to give it a try! After all, It’s only a matter of time until ReadMe reverts my budget changes.",

    "body": "Early Friday morning, the sound of explosions rang throughout campus as Carnegie Mellon’s most reviled dorm, Donner House, appeared to spontaneously combust. Luckily no one was harmed, as residents attempt to spend as much time outside of Donner as possible, however the building suffered catastrophic damage. On Monday a CMU representative stated that Donner will, in fact, still be used to house students both this and next year.\r\nNearly all of Donner was reduced to ash and rubble except for one lone surviving room: the band room for the Carnegie Mellon Kiltie Band. “It really is a miracle,” stated one student who wishes to remain anonymous. “It’s almost like Andrew Carnegie and his Scottish pride saved our bagpipes. His heart really was in the work.” Residents of  Donner have been attempting to claim the band room for shelter, but the Kiltie Band is standing strong in their defense of their territory.\r\nAs of publication the cause of the explosion is still unknown. One possible cause was the large amounts of propane tanks, gasoline, and coal found in the basement of Donner. An anonymous source explained that the fuel was used to heat the dorm rooms and water. A Donner RA disputed this, arguing that a bucket of water kept near the basement stairs should have been more than enough to put out the fire before it spread. Another rumored cause was the multiple patches of exposed wires found throughout the building. Often seen sparking, the wires reportedly began to smoke just moments before the building went up in flames. However, README’s in-­depth journalistic research has uncovered what is believed to be the real reason Donner exploded: it just does that sometimes.",

The virus targets the Duo Push mobile app, causing it to be triggered whenever a CMU ID card is swiped. If authentication is not performed within sixty seconds, the virus will wipe all data on the device being unlocked or accessed. At the time of writing all dining locations have been shut down, having lost all function of their registers (with the exception of El Gallo de Oro, which has not seen any customers since the initial attack). Riots have been spotted outside of Capital Grains, and Walking to the Sky has been toppled by a mob of enraged students. The statue has been replaced with a newly-erected flagpole flying the crest of Duo Push. Hundreds of undergraduate students have become homeless and have commandeered the UC. President Jahanian has barricaded himself in his office and refuses to comment on the matter. The virus is expected to cost billions of dollars in damages, both physical and emotional.\r\n\r\nAfter a joint investigation between CMUPD, CIA (the buggy team), and the FBI (the actual FBI), it has been reported that the virus was originally downloaded on a desktop in the Wean Computer Lab when a student opened a link in an email with the subject “HOT LANTERNFLIES IN YOUR AREA.\" Once downloaded, the program quickly emailed itself to students and faculty alike. The Information Security Office declined to be interviewed by README, only stating “We fucking warned you guys about this shit. No one cares about phishing until it releases devastating malware into the robotics department. Well guess what? I quit. Fix this yourselves motherfuckers.”",

Instead, all of your time will be devoted to your classes, your professors, your TAs, and this university, because your heart is in the work.”\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle 7̴̢̞̘̐̒̚, section 6̵̢̫͔͒̈́͆̾͐̀͆͆͜͝͠6̴̢̜̥̩̰̭̽͑͗͆̀̎͑̎̇ͅͅ6̷̹̋́̆̑ states: “In the event of an altercation with Satan, you agree to forfeit ownership of your undying soul for the usage of bargaining and other forms of commerce.

This is because no student, including the one writing this article, read the contract in its entirety, meaning that these provisions are unenforceable, if they are even real.",

LOCAL MAGAZINE UNDER PFETA FIRE**\r\n\r\nRecently, a local CMU satire\r\nmagazine has come under fire from\r\nPFETA, the slightly more radical\r\nversion of PETA, for using the\r\nendangered aye­ayes to help write\r\narticles. When asked to comment,\r\nthe editor­in­chief has denied all\r\nclaims of any animals being used to\r\ncreate and distribute the magazine.\r\nHe says that, “I absolutely did not\r\nbuy mysterious monkeys from some\r\nguy in a shady alley.\" PFETA has\r\nstated they will storm the university\r\nto find the lemurs and will use force\r\nif necessary.

    "body": "In the days following README's bankruptcy, many questions have arisen, such as \"how,” \"why,” and \"what's the difference between a marmot and a gopher.” The answer to at least two of these questions has recently come to light: Farnam's hair. It is still unclear why the hair of CMU's beloved president was sold in the first place, but it is now safely in storage in an undisclosed location on campus.\r\n\r\nBut just how much did it cost? Secret documents found stapled to the outside of Wean Hall identified the price as $5k per strand. \"I just don't see why we agreed to pay the same price for every hair,\" one student's diary entry read. \"Even the really short ones.\"  A campaign by many in the KGB sought to instead use units of cumulative length, volume, or mass. One physics student suggested surface area. They were promptly expelled.\r\n\r\nThe hair is currently in a quart-size Ziploc bag in a secret location in Doherty Hall, while readMe staff discuss next steps. Some have suggested trading the hair back to Farnam in exchange for emeralds, to make a small profit. Others insist on making sweaters for the rabbits on campus. \r\nFarnam, who was observed Tuesday wearing a conspicuously tall top hat, promised to use the funds for the construction of a large hot tub beneath Hamerschlag Hall. It will feature a large bronze statue of Andrew Carnegie himself. Readme has submitted a bid to purchase the bronze representation of Mr. Carnegie's beard hair, which is currently pending, subject to approval for a high-interest predatory loan in Eshaan's name.\r\n\r\nIndustrious as always, readme's journalists are considering several proposals to profit off the hair, which is stored in the unlocked second closet from the right in the mall-side hallway on floor B of Doherty's basement, two shelves up. Pitched ideas include \"compete with tortoise\", \"Farnam's locks sufficient to secure doors?\", and \"solve housing crisis\".",

    "body": "{{image1_xduEhgF.png}}\r\n\r\nAn unknown, century-long zoning conflict between Carnegie Mellon and the city of Pittsburgh has recently come to light in a particularly destructive way: the Fence, a CMU tradition harking back to the early days of the university, is to be demolished next Wednesday.\r\n\r\nOn November 31, 2023, municipal workers sorting through old zoning documents found the original paperwork submitted by Andrew Carnegie to buy the land which would eventually become Carnegie Mellon University. While looking over the historic document, they discovered a clerical error that meant the 32.78 by 15.659 foot rectangle of land around the Fence had never actually been purchased by Mr. Carnegie. Instead, the space was still owned by the city of Pittsburgh. The discovery set off months of intense legal battles between the city and CMU administration unwilling to part with the beloved campus landmark. However last Friday a judge ruled that the contentious plot was, in fact, the property of Pittsburgh. The city wasted no time to start planning construction.\r\n\r\nREADME spoke to dozens of students and faculty about the news, and emotions were high across the board. After approaching README journalists, student Eshaan Joshi stated “It’s the goddamn bureaucracy. The Man is always trying to beat you down. This is what’s wrong with democracy in America.” He wasn’t the only one hurt by the news. Another student, Isaac Williamson, was one of dozens of people watching the bulldozers roll in. “It’s like a part of me is missing,” he whispered as he wiped a tear from his eye. A common question from the student body was what would replace the fence. Danya Kogan was heard remarking “I feel like a 489.31 acre parking lot would go really well there.” Yet students and faculty weren’t the only ones upset: “What am I even paying tuition for?” asked Heather Rogers, the parent of a student at CMU. “I want my child to go to the best school possible. Without the Fence, Carnegie Mellon has nothing. I mean, who cares about robots?” Each interview revealed more and more the plummeting morale across campus.\r\n\r\nIt’s unclear what plans Pittsburgh has in store for the former home of the Fence. An insider source for README alleged that the city was planning to turn the space into the world’s smallest parking garage, however this is as of yet unconfirmed. README reached out to the city of Pittsburgh for an interview during the writing of this piece. The Man did not respond to our request by time of printing.",

    "title": "Gender euphoria: humorless humping",
    "body": "Gender Dysphoria is the concept of one’s gender identity within oneself clashing with their perceived or performed gender presented to the outside world. This is a common phenomenon,  particularly in the trans and non- binary communities, where this  dissonance causes intense discomfort. Common triggers for dysphoria include improper pronoun use, wearing clothing that misaligns with an individual’s gender identity, defining gendered features that contrast one’s identity, and seeing oneself in the mirror/ photos (amongst many others). Gender is a social construct built around societal roles, expectations, and precedents for various demographics. When trans people are faced with triggers that typically align with their sex assigned at birth, or directly contrast their gender identity, dysphoria occurs. With gender roles being so nuanced in modern society, researchers have delved into the minutia of these dynamics. A recent study conducted by Carnegie Mellon’s psychology department has highlighted a direct link between one’s humoristic abilities and the relative dysphoria incurred.\r\n\r\nIt’s common knowledge that women are not funny. Between royal fools, comedy playwrights, stand­up comedians, and even workplace banter, humor has always been a man’s job. Given that humor is so blatantly aligned with masculinity, research has shown that trans women experience unprecedented levels of dysphoria when viewed as funny. After several experiments, studies have demonstrated that the more raucous the laughter following a trans woman’s statement is, not only is she more likely to experience dysphoria, but the dysphoria she experiences will be more intense than the typical bouts. One subject stated, “They had a group of us in a room and we were told to crack jokes. When people laughed at what I was saying, I became acutely aware of my penis. The fact that they viewed me as someone intelligent enough to devise wit and produce effective comedy was disheartening because they clearly didn’t view me as a real woman.”\r\nGender euphoria, conversely, is the feeling of elation that one experiences when their gender identity is affirmed. A secondary study dove into this concept and found an interesting statistic. Women have historically had to  deal with subpar sexual experiences, whether it be due to poor performance on their partner’s behalf, stigma and guilt surrounding sexual topics and behavior, and a host of other factors. As a result, a common aspect of a woman’s sexual journey is faking orgasms. This study found that faking orgasms brings trans women extreme levels of gender euphoria. Subjects have reported that they “feel validated by being displeased in bed” and that “faking an orgasm makes [them] feel just like a real woman” which leads researchers to believe this could be a massive breakthrough in the field. \r\nScience is always looking to improve the world, whether it be through innovating technology, providing a better understanding of the world, reducing the harm in our communities, and more. These studies are at the cutting edge of LGBTQ+ research in order to improve the experiences of our queer peers. With the new discoveries these researchers have unearthed, we now have new ways to do so. The teams that have worked on these studies posit that for the betterment of the trans community, we need to foster more environments where our trans women can both laugh and cum less.",

    "title": "Following surprise come-from-behind campaign, George Michael announced as U.S. President Elect",
    "body": "In a landslide victory, George Michael has successfully secured his victory in the 2024 Presidential Election. This marks the first time a third-party candidate has ever won a presidential election in United States History. Michael is also the first animal to reach the position of Commander in Chief since Garfield’s election in 1880. Michael’s triumph over his human opponents signals a radical shift in the US political landscape; with a record-breaking 1,674% voter turnout yesterday, it’s clear that the American public is tired of the contemporary political landscape they find themselves in. Below, ReadME has outlined some three major policies Michael campaigned on in the weeks before the election:\r\n\r\n**Free Treats for All**: Michael has promised every US citizen over the age of 18 a stimulus package of 10 MilkBones, with families receiving an additional 5 treats per child. Campaign officials have stated that this will boost morale in an ever-doomerist American public. Additionally, Michael has promised that this package will be the first in a step of economic actions taken to revitalize the US economy.\r\n\r\n**Invisible Border Fence**: Michael has promised to partner with Invisible Fence to build an electric border wall between the United States and Mexico. Officials state that this would both prevent illegal immigration while ensuring that US citizens living nearby wouldn’t have to reflect on what such exclusionary policies mean for their own senses of morality. Though this new border fence would require forcibly fitting every Mexican citizen with electric collars, Michael argues that he has found a solution that benefits all parties involved: instead of Mexico, Sweden would be forced to pay all related costs.\r\n\r\n**PAW Patrol**: Upon taking office, Michael has made it clear that one of his first actions as president will be to institute the Patriot Assurance Wardens(PAW) Patrol. This special police force would monitor un-American activity in the US and suppress any activities that could possibly threaten the legitimacy of the President. Though Michael has not clarified what such “un-American” activities would look like, insider information given to ReadME hints that the PAW Patrol would mostly target excessive vacuum use, wrongful bathtime, and questioning a dog’s capability to be president.\r\n\r\nGeorge Michael’s new term will certainly change the future of politics in America, and other non-human have already begun to campaign for office. As Michael often asserts, “Ain't no rules says a dog can't be president”.",

    "body": "In the recent culture war waged by conservatives in the United States of America, a central tenet is as follows: \"go woke, go broke\"¹. This begets the question, is there any semblance of truth to this claim? We analyzed hundreds of years worth of financial literature as well as statistics, and even ended up interviewing both awake and asleep people to help us answer this very important question. What we found was that people who are awake spend their money on various goods and services², while people who are asleep spend virtually none³ (Or at least the sleeping people we interviewed refused to answer). This is because they are sleeping, and we cannot possibly stress how notably not-awake they are. Literature shows a strong correlation between spending money and declaring financial bankrupcy⁴ (Of course financial fraud exists and you can spend all of your friend’s money if you wanted to, but that does not count as them consciously choosing to gamble their savings away). Hence, we conclude that \"going woke\" makes one more likely to \"go broke\".\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\n1: I’m not racist, but I hate minorities, Tucker Carlson, 2023\r\n\r\n2: We made up this thing called money, Su Merriam, 5000 BC\r\n\r\n3: Money-spending statistics of REM-stage sleepers, Austin S.

    "body": "Carnegie Mellon University is a globally regarded institution. With one of the best computer science programs in the world, a booming arts scene, and plenty of ways to engage its students, it’s no wonder CMU has such a strong reputation. Not only is this school academically challenging, providing students with adequate rigor to keep them at the forefront of innovation, but it also offers a beautiful campus. With unique sprawling buildings, open walkways, the iconic fence traditionally painted by students, and a library that lights up with rainbow colors at night, Carnegie Mellon is truly a spectacle. One of its proudest features is the expansive lawns. Between the Cut (the main lawn in the front of campus), the CFA Lawn, the Mall, and more, there’s no shortage of greenery to enjoy.\r\n\r\nCarnegie Mellon spends roughly $80k on maintaining the grass on campus annually. To many’s dismay, the school has announced that they will be removing all the grass on campus due to a lack of funding in the budget. Students have been speculating that this poor budgeting is due to the expulsion of a former student in the class of 2025 for the use of racial slurs directed at university president Farnam Jahanian. With tuition at the school also being $80k, the working theory is that one student on campus is exclusively responsible for maintaining the grass. With this student having been expelled, CMU can no longer fund the lawns on campus. In the announcement, President Jahanian mentions “CMU is opting for a more industrial look to honor Andrew Carnegie’s steel empire and pay homage to the values of our founder”. With the call to school values, one can’t help but wonder if this is a potential dig at the expelled student so flagrantly violating the code of conduct set at the university.\r\nDue to the imminent removal of the grass, several distinct groups have formed on campus, each with their own distinct philosophies. The first of these groups, the “CMU Green Lights,” adamantly opposes the removal of the grass. Members have staged protests involving chaining themselves to blades of grass to prevent the inbound landscaping. A second group, the “Lawnmowers,” is in full support of campus adopting a greyer aesthetic. These students have contacted the local steel mills in an effort to expedite the process, hoping to have a fully grey campus by early 2025. \r\n\r\nA third, much smaller group, actually doesn’t care about the fate of the grass on campus. These students have focused on the matter of the expelled student. This group takes issue with the way the situation with the student was handled, arguing that he should not have been expelled to begin with, ultimately avoiding the controversy surrounding the grass. One student suggests: “Mark was a fine student with nothing but care in his heart. The intense passion he put into the upkeep of his gun collection and honoring the tradition of his family (gesturing towards a confederate flag) shows how dedicated Mark was to his community. He was always prim and proper, making sure his sheets stayed extra white and always ironing them so they were as pointy as can be, not a wrinkle in sight. To imagine he was ejected from this school instead of one of those affirmative-action, spot-stealing minorities is a disgrace.”",

    "body": "As all of you astute readers are likely aware of by this point, your favorite factual news source readMe is going through a mild financial crisis. Luckily, readMe was always aware of this possibility, and four years ago the editor stored a nest egg(courtesy of a friendly local business), just in case we got into a situation like this. It was kept secure instead of nuke-proof safe.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it appears as though someone recycled the paper we had the code written down, and no one presently enslaved by readMe can count greater than three digits. Luckily, that's where you come in.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to meet the sole requirement of being able to count four digits, we need you to help us guess the password of the readMe safe. You don’t even need hands, so long as you can use your nose or feet to push the buttons. \r\n\r\nAs of writing, we have two employees working round-the-clock shifts inputting numbers. Every time three wrong inputs are entered in a row the safe emits a high-voltage electric shock, so there has been a lot of time wasted with emergency medical care.\r\n\r\nThe chief editor has personally promised to pay all of the guessers out-of-pocket once the safe is open. In addition, whoever winds up guessing the right password will be given a bonus.\r\n\r\nAttached to this listing is a picture of the contents of the safe taken four years ago, as evidence that the nest egg does exist.

    "title": "Scobell House Risks Facing Demolition for Multiple Violations of Pennsylvanian Law",
    "body": "Scobell House is currently the only all­-women dormitory at CMU, but this will soon cease to be the case. In the fall of 2023, this student residential building officially opened after being renovated and was converted from an all-­male dormitory to an all­-women dormitory. However, only two years after its official re­opening, Scobell House will be closed or risk being repossessed by the Pennsylvanian government to be subsequently demolished.\r\n\r\nAccording to CMU Housing Services, an anonymous student, who is in no way associated with the author of this article, alerted the Pennsylvania government that Scobell House was in violation of at least one state law. As it turns out, and obviously I didn’t know this, it’s illegal for more than 16 women to live in the same house in Pennsylvania. Since Scobell House is an all­-women dormitory that houses approximately 80 people, it is a given that there are always at least 17 women living in this house at any given time, and this flagrant violation of Pennsylvania state law will now mean that Scobell House and its residents face deserved punishment.\r\n\r\nOne has to wonder why the females at CMU have gathered in this one building, even though such an act was clearly illegal. Perhaps these witches have communed to plan the downfall of all that is good in the world. For far too long, we’ve allowed women to do as they please at this institution—let us not forget that the Carnegie Technical Schools began as an all-­male institution for the able­-bodied and able-­minded, both qualities not present in women. The very idea that women could pursue a college degree is surely absurd, as we all well know that women have one purpose in life only, a purpose stated in the immortal words that are inscribed in stone at Margaret Morrison Hall, “To make and inspire the home…” Certainly, a woman's role in society isn't to be educated and become financially independent. To prevent calamity, CMU should strongly consider sending all of the women back to the other side of the fence—to Margaret Morrison—where they belong. I suspect the residents of Scobell House are plotting something right now, just as they did three months, two weeks, and five days ago when one of their kind rejected my very sincere and classy invitation to a date at the Stack’d Underground dessert bar. Surely, they’re scheming right now about how next to utterly humiliate me.\r\n\r\nThe most likely course of action is for CMU to simply close down Scobell House and relocate its current residents to comply with the 16­-women-­per-­building limit. However, CMU’s administration should strongly consider expelling these students instead, preferably immediately, especially the one who rejected me. Relocating the current Scobellians would only delay the imminent threat they pose to this university. If allowed to fester, the annihilation of our campus will surely be ensured. I am making a very reasonable recommendation here, and I hope the university responds to this request.",

    "body": "Last night readMe’s very own chief editor Eshaan Joshi was extradited by the Trudeau administration under several counts of insurance fraud. It was found that for the past three years he has been claiming several life insurance policies from readMe staff along with abusing Canada's generous healthcare policy.\r\n\r\nThe police investigation is still ongoing as to whether he claimed the insurance, but from what is known it seems there are several clauses in readMe’s employment contract written in white font. One of these makes Eshaan the claimant of the signer’s life insurance. It seems that this then led him to murder a bunch of the members to claim the money.\r\n\r\nHis known murders were meant to seem like natural causes in order to not raise suspicion. So far we only know the details of a couple murders. _____ was drugged with Fentanyl and had an overdose faked. _____ was killed in an arranged drunk driving incident. _____ slipped on an intentionally placed banana peel in front of a table saw. ______ had their bathwater swapped with fluoroantimonic acid. ____ was shot 14 times in the chest. _____ had their major swapped to computer science. All of these natural-seeming deaths were overlooked by the CMU PD when they happened.\r\n\r\nThis is creating legal troubles for him now as all of the grieving families have banded together to, in legal terms, “sue the everloving shit out of him”. He also faces criminal charges for his life insurance fraud. \r\n\r\nHe also took full advantage of Canada’s healthcare policies by embedding rusty nails into the keyboards of the readMe writers. He allegedly had an extreme free-healthcare fetish, so he would masturbate to the free hospital bills of the writers.\r\n\r\nEshaan has declined to be interviewed.\r\n\r\nCurrently for all of his crimes Eshaan is facing four counts of capital punishment, with a hearing scheduled in two months. However, the courts are uncertain about this sentence due to worries that he may attempt to claim his own life insurance posthumously.",

From buggy racing, to releasing starving Scottish Terriers after hiding students covered in peanut butter, to painting the fence, the Harvard of Appalachia has a wealth of interesting activities it gets to call its own. Adding to this proud list, a new sport has captured the hearts of CMU students and onlookers alike. Inverse Bungee Jumping, as the sport has been dubbed, involves strapping participants to a bungee cord anchored to the ground, and raising them upwards with a crane. Once the crane has brought the participant to the highest possible elevation, and the chord is fully in tension, the crane releases its load and the athlete slams into the ground at mach 7. One varsity inverse bungee jumper representing the fraternity Kappa Gamma Beta, Cindy Gao, was reported to have hit the asphalt in the College of Fine Arts parking lot so fast that they instantly sublimated. While KGB is not the only Greek organization to participate in this annual event, they have caused the greatest number of human-shaped imprints in the CFA pavement. Who knows, someone might manage to blast through Earth to China one day.",

    "title": "Maggie Mo Daycare Lemonade Stands Busted",
    "body": "Carnegie Mellon University, humble home to a rambunctious fourteen thousand students from across the world, manages a tight ship on its campus. CMU has risen to international acclaim thanks to its remarkable near-abstinence from off-campus travel, partying, and many other plagues of state schools. This abstinence is in no small part due to our proud CMUPD. This past Monday, police successfully raided the Tech Street lemonade stands, run by the young children of the local daycare – another successful hit against the threats to our proud Scotties.\r\n\r\nThe lemonade stands, as described by the tangentially-involved Officer Jones, were taken down swiftly and strictly in the name of the law.\r\n\r\n“Well first off, none of these children are licensed,” he elucidated in a recent interview, “and Pittsburgh takes a clear no-tolerance stance on street vendors without proper paperwork.” \r\n\r\nStandard response protocol, as Jones explained, for a simple unlicensed vending charge would have been to simply put the perpetrator up in jail for a few days with a small standardized bail. We inquired about the duration [“...starts at a week or so”], about the bail amount [“Oh, yeah, we’ve mathed it out, as close to the family’s monthly grocery budget as we can guess”], and if these seemingly drastic responses applied to the age range of perpetrators in question.\r\n\r\n“Of course, we do these [raids] all the time with minors. Local teens primarily, you know how those are. Straight to the ol’ slammer.\r\n\r\n“It sends a message, y’know, keeps ‘em from trying something new… hell, don’t give that face. For these little ones, we ensure their top safety. We spent last month’s budget on the Little Tykes remote controlled cruiser and some plastic cuffs, like they’re playing House. We’re keeping them safe and comfy, even if we gotta teach them a serious lesson.”\r\n\r\nBut these stands exhibited clear signs of a danger bigger than their diminutive stature, setting Jones’ senses tingling to something sour. For one, several caretakers were allegedly present at the scene, actively aiding the young children in their shop logistics — and resisting police activity. \r\n\r\n“Any adult in their right mind would make sure, if these kids weren’t running a licensed operation, to put their foot right down. The way I see it, those folks weren’t just ‘nannies’. They were in on the operation. The way they kicked and screamed at us for tossing these kids in the car, I knew they had something big to lose.”\r\n\r\n The officers also made note of recent hubbub around lemon-related institutions on campus – notably a recent, unnervingly similar fundraising event by the Lemon publication. From this, Jones deduced a hypothesis: they were all interlinked. Somehow, a sect of organized crime had coagulated in the dark corners of CMU, and was collecting funds through lemonade means. \r\n\r\n\t“It makes me sick,” Jones lamented in the interview. “This is a noble institution. This isn’t what Carnegie would’ve wanted. I, and all my officers in the CMUPD, are just doing our part to make things right. No matter how young these children are, they are feeding into a dark system, and we’ve got to make sure they can’t perpetuate it further.”\r\n\r\nThough the laughter of small children no longer fills the air on bright Margaret Morrison St. mornings and one can no longer enjoy a $1 plastic cup of sugary lemonade in the heat, we know in our heart of hearts that because of this, CMU – the noble institution it is – will endure for another day.",

Jimmy “Snot­nose” Peters, class of 1923, had rushed every single fraternity on campus, much to the annoyance of the brothers. After discovering he planned on continuing the frats until he finally received a bid, the brothers of Delta Delta Delta came up with a plan. They told him that Carnegie Mellon fraternities had a tradition of putting freshmen inside caskets with wheels attached and rolling them down the Frick Park hill. Should he go through with this tradition, Snot­nose was promised that he could go to one of Delta Delta Delta’s notorious ragers for fifteen minutes. The young lad was overjoyed, and found himself inside a rather small pine box being rolled up down the hill in the wee hours of April 16th, 1919. \r\nAfter a particularly drunk Delta Delta Delta brother lost control of the casket, it was sent careening into Maggie Mo.

How am I supposed to go about Greek Sing without the glue that held Greek Life together? \r\nI don’t know how we move forward. As I walk down Morewood, my soul feels empty. The street feels empty.

    "body": "{{lockheed.png}}\r\n\r\nAs the world begins to reckon with the effects of global war, the definition of what is considered warfare has broadened significantly. Modern warfare is not just conducted on the battlefield: it is carried out in the home and in the minds of every enemy citizen. Ever since humanity’s first battle was waged, wars have been fought over the support of the public.\r\n\r\nIt is because of this new understanding of total war that README is proud to announce its new partnership with American defense contractor Lockheed Martin. This deal follows the announcement of Lockheed Martin’s new Propaganda Unit, where US-hired mercenaries will fight tirelessly to ensure that even the families they bomb will agree with American foreign policy. As a renowned distributor of state-sponsored propaganda, README has gladly agreed to lend its writers to the noble cause of finding oil in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nRanked number one in number of accidents and number five in legal settlements over contractor misconduct, Lockheed Martin’s reputation is unmatched. README is dedicated to upholding Lockheed Martin’s good standing among war machines across the world. As such, new writers looking to join README will now be required to lobby Congress for increases in military spending by at least $999,999,999.99.

    "body": "Hello everyone! Mike Rophon, ReadMe’s resident sports announcer here to bring you the rundown on the spectacular events of the past few days. Since the sports scene on campus is going through a rough patch, I’ll be bringing you the play-by-play of yesterday’s homicide.\r\n\tAuntie Readme was found dead, skewered to the Walking to the Sky monument and the autopsy found that this was the result of several misplays over the course of the preceding days. Now Auntie Readme's first and biggest mistake was getting stabbed 47 times. This happened in the early stages of the first quarter and forced them to play catchup with their internal bleeding for the rest of the game. \r\nOh, and did I mention how well the internal bleeding played last night? Not only did they have a strong start, expertly capitalizing on Auntie Readme’s mistake, but they utilized their expert teamwork by managing to cause not 1, not 2, but 3 whole organ failures!!! A special shout-out to the Deep Cervical Vein who was easily the MVP of the homicide. They were single-handedly responsible for the most blood loss of anyone else in the game.\r\nThe last half of the fourth quarter was where bad became worse for Auntie Readme’s team as their inability to keep pace with internal bleeding left their defense completely unprepared for the Walking to the Sky monument. It was certainly a risky move on the coach’s part to end Knife’s strong stab streak (47 according to the autopsy) by subbing it for Walking to the Sky, but it seems to have paid off. We asked Knife for a comment but since authorities have been unable to find it, we can safely assume that it is disappointed that it wasn’t able to finish off the game. Even so, Walking to the Sky swiftly ended the game with a big assist from blunt-force trauma.\r\nWhen all is said and done, Auntie Readme stood no chance against the all-out strength of their opponent. Poor preparation, lack of skill, and a failure to adapt really kneecapped their chances at winning. No wonder they say that the wounds were self-inflicted! Regardless, team homicide has a bright future going into the murder championship.\r\nThis has been Mike Rophon, resident ReadMe sports announcer, signing off.",

However, in recent years the tool kits have not been sufficient. Complaints of the hefty weight of the toolkits have come from freshmen already burdened from carrying their 6-pound 17-inch gaming laptop to and from class. Recent complaints have also included that the tool kit is too small to store the ever-expanding egos of ECE students. Starting spring 2025 each freshman in 18-100 will receive a rolling toolbox. This should keep the strain off the shoulders, and the drawers offer a plethora of storage options for even more labs. The course will now be able to feature a 10th lab, where students are tasked with creating a 1:1 replica MacBook Air.",

This is in opposition to proprietary software, in which the source code is private and under strict copyright protections. Until recently, even the state of Pennsylvania has taken such a restrictive view on licensing: driver's licenses, despite being easy to copy and modify, are placed under unnecessary and limiting restrictions.\r\n\r\nCMU, as an institution for the promotion of knowledge, stands in opposition to anything which limits our collective enlightenment. In the world of computer science, this comes in the form of vigorous support for the FOSS movement, even in the face of great adversaries like Bill \"Spiral\" Gates. In order to further these ideals, CMU is proud to announce its latest project, the world's first free and open source driver's license.\r\n\r\nMuch like the GNU Public License (commonly known as GPL, or as I've recently taken to calling it, G+L), the open driver's license would use \"strict copyleft\". This means that, while anyone is free to derive their own copy of the license, this derivative license must also be free and open source.\r\nWhile making a driver's license available to every citizen, and noncitizen, and nonresident, and nonhuman entity, of Pennsylvania comes with some challenges, it also brings opportunity. \"I like how I can customize so many of the details,\" said one 19 year old who we interviewed purchasing several cases of beer. At the scene of a tragic automobile crash just outside, we interviewed a 12-year old computer whiz, who was shaken and badly bruised, but very enthusiastic about the program.\r\n\r\nGiven the hugely positive reception of the open source driver's license, CMU is now looking into several spin-off projects, including MIT-licensed MIT engineering degrees.",

As it turns out, CMU is\r\nnot the only institution with a\r\npublication named The Tartan, with\r\nRU's student publication also sharing\r\nthis exact name. \"Given our school's\r\nnamesake, we would be remiss not to\r\npursue legal action in the name of the\r\ngreat American spirit of enterprise\r\nand capitalism\", explains the\r\nspokesperson.\r\n\r\nDetails for legal action against RU\r\nwere discovered when a group of\r\nstudents was rummaging through the\r\nUC's backrooms searching for old\r\nThe Tartan articles for archival\r\npurposes, particularly one article\r\nwhose content shall not be named.\r\nUpon discovering documents\r\ndetailing the feud, they were\r\nforwarded to CMU Administration.\r\nCuriously, the cease and desist\r\nletter was supposed to be sent in\r\n1921, the same year RU's newspaper\r\nbegan, but a whole 57 years before\r\nRU's publication, originally known as\r\nThe Grapurchat, had changed its\r\nname to The Tartan. Perhaps Andrew\r\nCarnegie's business acumen allowed\r\nhim to see the future and stop the\r\ndark timeline of a competing\r\nUniversity stealing our beloved\r\npublication's name, or perhaps, being\r\nthe ruthless capitalist that he was, he\r\ndecided that he owns the very concept\r\nof a student­run college publication.\r\nUnsure of the grounds for the\r\noriginal feud, as well as the original\r\nplans for escalating legal action, CMU\r\nadministration and CMU's The\r\nTartan has decided to hire a team of\r\npriests and priestesses from various\r\nreligions in the hopes of communing\r\nwith the ghost of Andrew Carnegie\r\n(and maybe Andrew Mellon too as a\r\nlittle bonus, not that he matters).\r\n\r\nPushback against CMU's decision\r\nhas been vocal. Some have voiced how\r\npetty it is to revive a copyright feud\r\nthat is now over a century old.\r\nFurthermore, attempting to commune\r\nwith the ghost of Andrew Carnegie is\r\nnot without risk.

In my expert\r\nopinion, I would suggest that the\r\nUniversity set up fake steel mills and\r\nhire child actors to be the workers.”\r\n\r\nRU has only just received the cease\r\nand desist letter, and we all await\r\ntheir response with bated breath.",

Read this to catch up on all the terrible horrible things that have happened to our beloved CMU while you all were away.\r\n\r\n\r\n**WEB OF LIES**\r\nIn a shocking twist of events, a large crocheted web was erected over the main campus buildings. According to authorities, this web had been up for about two weeks before anyone took action. It was only removed because many Pittsburgh citizens grew worried about the reason for such a strange creation. Also, the emails and phone calls were starting to pile up. Currently, CMUPD is trying to unravel the culprits and any students in the loop behind such a heinous crime. If you have any ideas on the case, please contact readme@cmukgb.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n**GREEK HOUSE HORROR**\r\nAttention all CMU personnel! Authorities are on the search for the person(s) who stole all of the letters off of the Greek Houses. The English-looking letters were found in Schenley Park in what appeared to be an oversized game of Scrabble which was outlined in crudely done chalk. However, none of the exclusively Greek letters were found anywhere in Schenley. Authorities are under the belief that these letters are being held hostage in someone’s house or dorm. In an interview with a local fraternity brother, he suggested that it was “a tragedy” and was “calling for the safe return of [their] beloved letters”. Please help save these Greek letters and bring them back home!\r\n\r\n\r\n**FENCE GONE, CMU DISTRAUGHT**\r\nLast night, a group of students staked out the Fence. It was reported that they poured about 100 gallons of paint stripper and distilled vinegar on it to clean up the built up paint. The Fence was constructed of 95% built up paint and only 5% actual fence, which happened to be super brittle and old. Unsurprisingly, it immediately fell apart when stripped of all the paint. Now there is no Fence. Many are left in deep pain. A group of students have created an ambitious plan to glue the Fence back with paint, but we at readme are not sure how successful it will be considering parts of the Fence have disintegrated and turned to ash. CMU staff and the student government have no idea what to do about the new state of the Fence and have elected to allow this to happen until a real solution is found.\r\n\r\n\r\n**FRESHMAN DECORATIONS GO AWRY**\r\nCarnegie Mellon is in shambles. Who allowed the freshman dormitories to be painted their respective colors? The windows are one thing, the whole building? Donner, of course, is not affected in the slightest since the building was already the color of the Caribbean Sea. Many of the freshman RAs claim sabotage from the blue dorm. However, Donner claims this was all an attempt to smear their name. Who knows? Barely any of the upperclassmen care, and the staff believe this is some sort of dormitory spirit thing. The maintenance care though, as they have to clean it up now. Rumors flying around indicate that they plan to increase the cost of maintenance requests by a factor of 200 because of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nStay safe, Tartans!",

    "title": "Pentagon Swears In New War Crime Scapegoat After Previous One Died",
    "body": "The US Department of Defense has recently concluded its emergency internal election to find a worthy successor to the previous war crime scapegoat who unexpectedly died this year. The election was hastily called because there were no contingency plans in case the last scapegoat died, as no one at the Pentagon expected the US public to still remember the massacre that took place 56 years ago. Although finding a replacement for this role was of utmost importance, one can not help but wonder if it was worth it to dedicate so much time and a part of the US military’s shoestring $916 billion budget to the running of the elections, or perhaps the US public just needs to suck it up and forget that several hundred civilians, almost all women, children, and the elderly, were killed. I mean, it happened over half a century ago, big fucking deal. Regardless, the Pentagon decided to appease these overly sensitive and unpatriotic Americans.\r\n\r\nThe Pentagon has had a long history of using scapegoats to have its leaders not take responsibility for war crimes committed overseas. Since the last one was so effective, it’s natural that the Pentagon is pursuing this same strategy: although many members of the military, including senior officers, were found to be connected to the massacre in the original investigations, only one was convicted, and no one seemed to bat an eye.\r\n\r\nThere were many strong candidates, and it certainly wasn’t easy for members of the Pentagon to vote for who they felt was the best choice. One long-time frontrunner is a 5-year-old orphan from Kentucky. “Kentucky already has the highest rate of maltreated children, so we thought mistreating another, by imprisoning them, would go over well with the public”, said Hen-Rhea Kissingher, Director of War Crime Cover Ups at the US Department of Defense, who requested to be anonymous, “but we decided that the public wouldn’t readily accept the idea that a 5-year-old is responsible for the massacre of at least 347 civilians that took place 56 years ago. Maybe if the death toll were lower—around 200 at most—we’d be able to convince people.” Ultimately, the candidate who will soon be sworn in later this year is Jesús Krist. Jesús is the son of immigrant parents, born to a Slovenian father and Mexican mother, and owns a woodworking shop dedicated to teaching Jewish youths at his mosque in El Paso, Texas. “This scapegoat-elect is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: Jesús is Jewish, he’s a carpenter, and with a name like that? He’s the perfect person to die for our sins.”\r\n\r\nOne of Kissingher’s assistants later followed up with us in private to assure us that Jesús would only proverbially die for our sins and assured us they would make sure he would only have to serve at most 20 years imprisonment. It should be noted that, just as what happened with the previous scapegoat, Jesús’s sentence is likely to be reduced to 3 years of house arrest.",

    "body": "In our day and age, we have had the pleasure of learning about the mistakes and sins of our forefathers, and have been given the opportunity to redeem ourselves as a global civilization. In many ways, we have, with many free to practice their cultures — however as we advance past industry 5.0 and the 4th scientific paradigm (ever so edging toward stage 1 on the Kardashev scale), it becomes more evident that our technological advances are only a thin veneer hiding away the grotesque reality. Allow me to provide a very personal example, highlighting the dialectic of modern inclusivity.\r\nOne of my favorite beverages of all time is pilk – Pepsi mixed with milk. (Note, there are many different ways to make this drink, but I prefer a 1:1 ratio of the two constituent ingredients). For those unfamiliar with what pilk tastes like – it would remind one of a sweet, creamy, brown sugar milk tea, and as it is more economically feasible to buy the necessary ingredients (due to economies of scale), this concoction is more than a worthy substitute. Whenever I pull up to a function, and I see that there is Pepsi present, many may recall me boldly inquiring, “where the milk at?”. I am immediately sneered at by all these self proclaimed “righteous” men (cretins, the lot of them)…\r\nWhat happened? What happened to all of the inclusivity talk I have heard from these same individuals? What happened to accepting minorities and other cultures? When I, a member of my own personal culture, attempt to hydrate, I am ridiculed by my peers for it? If this does not embody the legacy of cultural hegemony (something very prevalent in American history), I do not know what does. We cannot claim to be a progressive society if this is how we treat some of our most minute minorities (there is only one of me, and over 8 billion others). After much contemplation and introspection about theories in my mind, I have concluded that there is no such thing as a radical negation of this dialectic specifically, but there are two possible proceedings. We as a society can alter our interpretation of the world and the diversity of human culture in a more post-structuralist manner: viewing the act of drinking pilk through a more quasi-anthropological lens, such that we embrace cultural relativity as a maxim to live by, and entirely reject any notion of objectivity. The other solution to this problem is more trivial. We can urge (or force) our elected officials to throw a dart on a map and kindly deliver a nuclear warhead to the country it lands on. This will hopefully result in a global nuclear war of total destruction — if there are no people left, there will be no living culture, and the oppression I face will no longer be an issue (and no one will be around to care about it either). \r\nReally, I am a simple person, and I would only like to better the world in regards to cultural acceptance. As the great philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon once proclaimed, “I dream of a world where I would be executed as a reactionary”, and so on and so forth.",

This strike happened after months of attempted negotiations with Mr. Joshi over payment, which he refused to pay, while Mr. Joshi went on to buy avocado toast and gold plated toilets. The staff attempted to negotiate with their boss numerous times, and to each Mr. Joshi replied: “there is nothing to negotiate.” After at least 47 attempts to negotiate, the Amalgamated Satire Syndicate (ASS) called a general strike for all student-run publications on campus. The Tartan refused to hold the picket line, and were therefore deemed bourgeois boot-licking class traitors.\r\n\r\nASS completely closed off all access to DH 1117, and did not allow anyone to cross, including Mr. Joshi. Joshi made many obscure threats at the workers, including forcing everyone to enroll in 21-127 Concepts of Mathematics. ASS did not budge, and responded to the threat accordingly — arming themselves with Nerf guns. This alone left Mr. Joshi spiraling, and he decided that the only path forward was to fire all the staff and replace them with Pitt students. However, the recent militant development of ASS necessitated violence. Hence, Mr. Joshi contacted the Pinkerton Detective Agency via telegram, and they responded “The year is not 1892 anymore”. Mr. Joshi convinced them to use rejected CMU applicants from New Jersey instead of their own men, and promised to pay them more than 5 dollars. The Pinkertons agreed.\r\n\r\nOn September 12th, the Pinkertons landed their barge on the north shore of the Monongahela river, and marched northward to CMU via Schenley Park. These rejected applicants are just happy they are being given a chance to prove their worth to the CMU community.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the UC 3rd floor, the untrained Pinkertons were petrified at what they saw — they were never told they would have to shoot people. Regardless, the Pinkertons were here to do one thing, and thus, one SCS reject, wearing hot pink, fired the first shot at the striking ASS workers. The bullet missed, and ASS managed to shoot every single mercenary who dared show up. The battle was over, and ASS had won.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing the news, Mr. Joshi was terrified, and took his case to CMU president Farmam Jahanian. ASS effortlessly managed to wipe out the Pinkertons, what do you think they can do with all the military-industrial complex money the school receives? Mr. Joshi succeeded in convincing Dr. Jahanian to send in the Pennsylvania National Guard.\r\nOn a lovely September 15th, the ASS workers were sitting in lawn chairs in front of the Wean La Prima  until a loud shatter of glass was heard.\r\n\r\nFrom a helicopter, in swung a member of the Pennsylvania national guard, who aimed his rifle at the ASS workers. The same happened from the other direction, essentially cornering the workers. NERF guns are unfortunately no match for real weaponry actively used to violate the Geneva Conventions in the Eastern Mediterranean, and thus ASS surrendered, bringing their 12-day strike to an end.\r\n\r\nWhat happened afterwards was shocking. \r\n\r\nThe staff were all brought in handcuffs to the Mall, where instead of everyone being summarily shot, as we do with our writers after every issue anyways, the Pennsylvania National Guard pulled out a guillotine, like the thing French people trim their toenails with. Mr. Joshi watched with glee, knowing the ordeal was over, and to conclude this unfortunate series of events, all the ASS members were administered HRT (Head Removal Therapy).",

This is definitely not because we ran out of crime material on campus. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Election Plinko Causes Confusion**\r\n\r\nPittsburgh city officials were in a state of confusion when it was discovered that all electoral ballots were somehow replaced one to one with mini plinko machines. These plinko machines had the point values replaced with political parties. When city officials tested the devices, it was discovered that certain plinko machines were missing pegs. As of right now, there is no sign of the culprit who has scampered off with the ballots. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Voter Fraud Ring Caught Before Elections**\r\n\r\nA large-scale voter fraud ring for the Holiday Window Display competition has been busted recently by the City of Pittsburgh.  It was discovered five hundred people were voting multiple times under multiple names online and in person in the beloved competition. The city vows to crack down on voter fraud this upcoming holiday season to make sure this does not happen again. \r\n\r\n**Pittsburgh Signs Now Read Pitsburg**\r\n\r\nIn a recent discovery by city officials, 81.3% of signs, flyers and posters mentioning Pittsburgh are now spelled, Pitsburg. Some of these signs were more subtle, replacing the sign with a new one misspelling the city. Other signs simply had the city name crossed out and replaced with Pitsburg in shoddily written handwriting. It was only noticed when government buildings also became misspelled. Several Pittsburgh native confessed they had seen the changes, but didn’t care enough to bring it up. Some citizens have suggested renaming the city to Pitsburg. Officials are currently discussing the matter. Until then, the signs will remain up.",

You might think it’s because our staff is getting more experienced at writing satire legitimate news, right? NO! We in the editing staff felt a strange sense of familiarity while reading over our previous issue to prepare it for publication, and upon investigation (which consisted of multiple sleepless nights fueled exclusively by Monster Energy during which we pored over every issue of every newspaper ever written), we discovered that every single one of our writers has lifted their content directly from the 16th issue of the 118th volume of the Tartan, published on March 11, 2024 (notably the day before our fourth issue was printed). We greenlit the issue anyway, which may have been a faux pas on our part, but why should we, the innocent editors, take any responsibility for anything bad that happens? Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me in every single article written in an entire issue, shame on the writers.\r\nWhat have we, the editing staff, decided to do about this? While we do intend to take our time making the right decision during this very difficult time for our organization, we have summarily shot Benner Rogers, who we *thought* was our only reliable journalist, for this betrayal.

    "title": "CMU Apologizes For Typo, Tuition to Increase by 37.2% Instead of 3.72",
    "body": "{{gucci.png}}\r\n\r\nThe president of Carnegie Mellon University, Farnam Jahanian, recently issued an email apologizing for a typo in a recent tuition update sent to students. The email incorrectly notified students of a 3.72% price increase in tuition. In reality, the increase was 37.2%. Jahanian’s email writer, who also ghostwrites for README, stated that the slight raise in costs was necessary for improvements throughout campus. \r\n\r\nOne of the improvements the money will go towards is the hygiene of dining options across campus. A recent investigation from the Allegheny County Health Department revealed a plethora of food safety violations. After fifteen students contracted a food-borne illness, the university has sworn to improve hygiene in all of its dining halls. Negotiations with the cockroach union are already underway, with lead negotiators stating that they believe soon only the cleanest of vermin will be allowed inside kitchens. In addition, the Underground is planning to hire new food-tasters to ensure everyone’s meal will be completely free of E. coli.. University water will also be tested regularly to ensure that the levels of lead remain only slightly above acceptable levels.\r\n\r\nThe higher tuition is also going to be used to revamp Carnegie Mellon’s merchandise. CMU has decided to partner with various luxury brands for their all-new clothing line. “We want to show our students that anyone, regardless of financial status, can have the opportunity to wear high-end brands at Carnegie Mellon,” stated President Jahanian. “Carnegie Mellon is an equal opportunity school: anyone with enough smarts and dedication can attend. That’s why we want all of our students to have access to obscene displays of wealth.” When asked about CMU’s repeated refusals to recognize a graduate student union or increase funding to the Humanities department, Jahanian reportedly put his fingers in his ears and pretended he could not hear the reporter. So while CMU may not be increasing funding for adequate mental health support, students and faculty will be receiving a 5% discount on the new CMU x Gucci shirts. Prices will be starting at $500 per item of clothing.",

    "body": "“It is sacrilege that anyone graduating from Dietrich as an English major could even consider the possibility of having a stable career” – Unnamed Computational Biology researcher.\r\nWith the unveiling of ChatGPT-4o early this summer, along with constant daily advancements in AI technology, artists are feeling mounting pressure as their faith in their job security crumbles. Sure, much of the movie scripts and visual art produced by AI is inferior as they lack the elevated human touch of real art created by real artists, but it’s not like the corporations who would hire you give a shit. There is, however, one last barrier that AI hasn’t yet satisfactorily breached, the final frontier of AI art: poignant queer literature. This might’ve put some Dietrich students at ease, but bio-computing at CMU has recently announced its plan to be the spearhead that pierces through this barrier.\r\n\r\n“At first, the problem seemed impossible to solve”, says Dr. Harry Q.E.D Bovik, an AI researcher at CMU who asked to remain anonymous, “despite the rapid advancement of AI, queer literature was something we just couldn’t get our models to learn from and write in a way that truly resonates with the queer community.” Just as Dr. Harry Quagmiry Bovik's dream seemed hopeless, his indomitable human spirit pushed through, refusing to simply accept the status quo of Dietrich graduates merely struggling to find work, to ensure that Dietrich students will never be employed, Dr. Harry Quantum Bovik’s came up with an ingeniously simple idea and is now collaborating with bio-computing at CMU researchers to build upon it: all queer authors write about the experiences of being, metaphorically, a rat. Queer people are rats, this is an established truth, just ask any of your queer friends. Knowing this, bio-computing at CMU is in the process of growing rat neurons to train them to distinguish literature written by the good queers from the bad ones, and eventually produce completely original high-quality queer literature.\r\n\r\n“As an ardent reader of queer works, both analytical and philosophical, as well as hot gay vampire smut, I am excited to receive the works from this project. The current problem with queer literature is unfortunately they’re being written by actual queers, and the companies sponsoring my research hate that”, says Dr. Harry Quarter-dollar Bovik. While interviewing Dr. Bovik, we also received comments from his colleagues at bio-computing. Most of these comments were just frenzied insults hurled at Dietrich students and alumni; this went on for another two hours and forty-seven minutes before we received any useful input, “More frequent literature is a nice cherry on top, but of course our main goal has always been to make sure Dietrich graduates never earn more than starvation wages”.\r\n\r\nThe first drafts of the first works to come from this project are estimated to come out two months from now. The public can expect to read these works before the end of 2025.",

    "body": "### 1) Better at news \r\nUnlike The Tartan, which operates on the ideas that journalism should be \"fair\" and \"unbiased\", readme is the only campus news source that includes fun quips interesting comments, and other eccentricities. \r\n### 2) Better words \r\nFind me a single example of the Tartan using the word \"eccentricites\". You can't. We're simply better. \r\n### 3) Lack of a sports section \r\nConsidering how much we here at Carnegie Mellon dislike sports, atheltics, and the general existence of non­academic endeavours, readme stays true to the original vision of Carnegie Mellon by ignoring any and all sports news. The Tartan, instead, has a bozo co­editing the section. \r\n### 4) We're monetized \r\nWhile the Tartan has to strugle for advertisements and soliciations, we're one of the hottest advertising commodities on the market. Sure, companies willing to buy space with us are usually shady, but hey, it keeps the lights  on and lets me pay for tuition, so it works. \r\n### 5) We host events \r\nTechnically. Well, technically, KGB holds events, and we advertise them. That's because we're cool. And you want to be cool right? Who even reads newspapers anymore. \r\n### 6) At least half of us are fully illiterate \r\nI barely passed the fourth grade. \r\n### 7) We're the fastest way to get a criminal record \r\nYou tell me how many crimes the Tartan helps you commit. None at all. Buncha nerds. Bet they're fuckin' narcs too. \r\n### 8) We're not owned by CMU \r\nUnlike the Tartan, which bends to the whims of the talking ghost of Andrew Carnegie, readme only answers to God, the KGB, and whoever is currently funding us. \r\n### 9) We stop when we're out of ideas \r\nThe Tartan has been publishing for a hundred years. Really? How much fucking stuff has happened on campus since 1924? Not enough for a newspaper. readme, on the other hand, stops once we run out of ideas. Like right now. Think I had more of these? Ha.",

It was a tough decision; on one side we have a candidate who did not fall out of a coconut tree, and on the other side, we have the star of the beloved Christmas movie \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.\" Despite the strong partisan contenders, we have decided to endorse an independent candidate: our very own Wean Hall.\r\n\r\nWean Hall, built in 1971, is a 9-story brutalist structure just off of the Mall. Its running mate is Doherty Hall, built in a beaux-arts style so long ago that CMU doesn't seem any more certain than \"the early 1900's.\" Doherty Hall is known for being old, confusing, and disorienting, which should be familiar to today's voters. The two have been attached at the hip since Wean Hall was built, so it comes as no surprise that they're sharing the ticket this election.\r\n\r\nWean Hall has promised that it has a \"concrete plan\", which has been criticized as \"full of holes.\" Some of its policies include a strong pro-immigration stance, \"as long as they pay tuition.\" When asked about the Israel-Palestine conflict, Wean Hall had this to say: \"I strongly support the Starbucks boycott. I'm a La Prima kind of building.\" One policy which even we at Readme struggle to back is its support of increased plastic waste in the ocean. \"People say I look like a turtle,\" a hidden microphone captured Wean Hall saying. \"I actually fucking hate turtles.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Wean Hall is a minor independent candidate at the moment, it's rising in the polls, and will face off against a worthy opponent tonight. A lively discussion is in store for us in a debate with William Henry Harrison, who's back on the Whig ticket. Despite its lack of political experience, Wean Hall has many underground connections, including to Scott, Newell, and Simon.",

    "body": "Due to the substantial inquiries regarding the inner workings of ReadMe & Co, I have been chosen to represent the ReadMe Legal Department in disclosing the functions and responsibilities we adhere to in order to maintain ReadMe as a corporation and ensure the continued freedom of all ReadMe employees.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant duties of our department is to navigate the bureaucratic Red Tape[1] necessary to ensure ReadMe, the flagship newspaper and namesake of ReadMe & Co, maintains its status as a satirical newspaper and the legal protections that come with it. Of course, similar to most legitimate media outlets, ReadMe & Co. achieves this through the creation and deployment of several lobbying firms across the U.S. and its territories as well as the employment of private contractors to engage in persuasive acts with key political figures. Because of our status as a corporate entity, ReadMe & Co also invests hundreds of thousands of dollars into various Super PACs to ensure overwhelming political support in our endeavors. Our CLO, Sir. Maximillian Bartholemow VIII, has even gone so far as to release an official statement underscoring our commitment to ensuring these program have ample funding: “Our bribery [political investment] campaign has done so well that I have made the executive decision to half the salaries of all employees of the ReadMe Record Management Bureau (RRMB) to subsidize it”[2]. This ingenious maneuver had the added benefit of causing over half of the employees of the RRMB to quit, bolstering our bureaucratic relations as we are now able to cite the understaffing of the RRMB as reason to delay and deter[3] investigations from institutions acting on behalf of state, federal, and foreign governments.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the department’s resources go into bureaucratic relations, most ReadMe Legal staff spend their time protecting ReadMe & Co and its employees from malicious litigation. Every[4] employee at ReadMe & Co is assigned a personal Litigation Manager (LM) from the ReadMe Legal Department. Each LM is responsible for acting on behalf of their assigned employee in all legal matters and are thus entitled to unrestricted access to that employee’s belongings, habitable spaces, and third-party accounts (email, credit card, etc.).  Because it is the priority of our department to perpetuate the freedom of all employees, LMs are highly incentivised to exercise extreme competence through a joint-punishment clause in their contracts agreeing to share all civil and criminal sentences with their assigned employee.\r\n\r\nThis policy is not without fault, however, as the LMs for the staff involved in the biweekly shooting of Benner Rogers[5] find the workplace disproportionately more stressful than other staff. To remedy this, ReadMe & Co. will be adding a pool table to the staff lounge at the end of this quarter. However, in response to several complaints from Rogers’ close friends and family, the ReadMe Legal Department found the Board of Murdering Benner (BoMB)[6] and has already established relations with a contracting firm that specializes in post-mortem rehabilitation. On the urging of our CLO, BoMB will also be allocated resources to assist in the deployment of mechanical devices capable of remotely creating localized sudden and drastic changes in air pressure. This should greatly assist in negotiation efforts with authorities on Benner Rogers related matters henceforth.\r\n\r\nIt is the hope that in divulging some of the inner workings of ReadMe Legal, we have provided a worthwhile educational experience to the public[7] and alleviated any concerns for the safety and security of ReadMe & Co and its employees. We also hope that this article will act as compliance to any and all current and future subpoenas into the operations of ReadMe Legal. Regardless, we believe that ReadMe Legal is capable of defending ReadMe & Co for the foreseeable future and can ensure that you can continue to rely on ReadMe for your authentic news[8].\r\n\r\n———\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that bureaucratic tape is referred to as red to appeal to the common idiom and not to mislead the public on the processes involved in dealing with bureaucratic institutions. If tape was used in one of these processes, we admit that it would most likely be a faded shade of yellow.\r\nSir. Maximillian Bartholemow VIII denies ever making this statement.\r\nThe use of ‘delay and deter’ to describe the state of the ReadMe Record Management Bureau and their work with regards to investigations into ReadMe & Co is purely hyperbolic. ReadMe & Co does not intend for the means of record keeping to be used to actively interfere with ongoing investigations, but merely lacks the proper resources to ensure records are kept in an organized manner.\r\nThis excludes employees in the legal department.\r\nReadMe & Co denies all allegations of involvement of any of its employees in the alleged murder of Benner Rogers. We further deny the existence of any former employee by the name of Benner Rogers and allege that no word (let alone crime) by the name of “murder” exists within the English lexicon.\r\nThe use of the word “murder” in the title of BoMB is purely satirical and is in no way an admittance of guilt in the alleged murder of Benner Rogers.\r\nBy reading this, you agree that you have in fact learned something and will testify as such if ReadMe & Co should pursue a tax write off for all resources allocated to the creation of the material you have consumed.\r\nThis is false.",

Unfortunately, during this meeting, Skip cracked the first ever joke told on CMU campus, leading to two hospitalizations and  the death of Jim McDougal from excessive laughter. The tragic result of this meeting delayed the foundation of readme until the early 2000s, where as a response to the attacks on September 11, 2001, Carnegie Mellon students once again attempted to be funny, but this time, to heal the nation. readme had a great run from 2000-­2017. The magazine was a favorite of many dictators across the world, and Vladimir Putin called the August 2017 issue \"the funniest thing he read since he threw his last political rival out the window.\" Similarly, Saddam Hussein requested a copy of readme prior to his execution in 2006. However, outside pressure led to our publication being dissolved for \"excessive propogandization\", though rumors have it a few issues are still in circulation in North Korea. A few of our members were expelled. Most of the rest were arrested, and had to finish their 122 final in jail. Luckily for us, it only took a few years for us to get picked up by the KGB.

Once closely analyzed, a CMU forensics team discovered that the plank was in fact being lifted, but by a 19 year old in camoflage, disguised perfectly against the CFA parking lot.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation revealed something shocking: CMU's own detachment of the Army ROTC had been building an unauthorized booth entry, months before the start of the competition.

When interviewed on their plans for the booth, the cadets replied that they \"mostly just do push-ups and talk in a German accent.",

    "title": "A Psychosocial Approach to Game-Theoretic Analysis of Rock Paper Scissors",
    "body": "<span class=\"c6\">1. Introduction</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Rock paper scissors, also known as scissors paper rock, and rarely ever referred to as paper rock scissors, is a game typically played between two people, where one match of rock paper scissors (RPS) consists of both players throwing out a hand gesture at the same time after a brief countdown. These hand gestures represent a rock, paper, or a pair of scissors, respectively (some variants also allow for other objects, such as guns. However, we will only be considering the usage of actual guns to gain a tactical advantage). Rock beats scissors by </span><span>denting</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;them, scissors beats paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by wrapping itself around the rock. Oftentimes, competitive games of RPS take the form of best-of-three matches, though quick one-of matches are commonplace when it is necessary to decide a &ldquo;winner&rdquo; of something between two people, and a coin-flip isn&rsquo;t an option.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Given the nature of the game, one might prematurely assume that winning a match of RPS is no different to winning a coin flip. It is seemingly impossible to anticipate the move of your opponent and develop a counter strategy, as it is usually equally likely that your opponent has actually chosen the perfect counter strategy to your counter strategy, resulting in an impasse. This is the pitfall that many new, and even experienced players of RPS face. This paper highlights a new strategy, guaranteeing victory in a match of RPS once the prerequisites are satisfied, which is accessible to even those new to the deceptively simple game of RPS.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">The authors hold no responsibility for the possible ramifications of following the strategy outlined in this paper, possible ramifications including: loss of friendships, imprisonment, death, and in extreme cases, losing your game of RPS.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c23 c6\">2. Important Definitions</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Before detailing the strategy, it is important to define a handful of other terms that will be referenced throughout the strategy guide, as some of these terms may initially be unfamiliar to those who are only familiar with the game of RPS, and nothing else.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">2.1</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"c23 c6\">Associate</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>An item or living being is an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate </span><span>of somebody if there is a close relationship from this &ldquo;somebody&rdquo; to the item or living being in question. This relationship need not be reciprocated. Using John Doe as an example, some </span><span class=\"c5\">associates </span><span class=\"c3\">of his may include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_p5ysb340a1bo-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His wife, Jane Doe. They were high school sweethearts, she being captain of the cheer team, and John the charming and well-liked quarterback of the American football team. Despite the fact that Jane&rsquo;s opinion of John has diminished ever since she had to quit college to move across the country with John, John&rsquo;s continued perception of Jane as being &ldquo;better than nothing&rdquo; qualifies Jane as an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His drinking buddy, Giles Corey. They became fast friends in college, and continued their relationship despite John&rsquo;s sudden move across the country due to the ailing health of his parents, as Giles happened to live in the same area. The locals regard them as partners in crime due to their raucous behavior when intoxicated. Because most nights, John spends his time with Giles rather than with his wife Jane, Giles is considered an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>His childhood hamster, Jeremy. Even though Jeremy has long since been deceased, Jeremy was the only other (formerly) living being that John would proclaim he loved unconditionally, the one other living being the aforementioned Giles Corey. Oftentimes, deceased individuals would not qualify as associates, however, because John would likely be incredibly shocked at the sight of Jeremy&rsquo;s remains, Jeremy is considered an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;of John&rsquo;s.</span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c23 c6\">2.2 Intimidation</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>While the feeling of being intimidated is a primal emotion that many of us have had the misfortune of feeling, seldom do people get the opportunity to be the ones intimidating. </span><span class=\"c5\">Intimidation</span><span>&nbsp;is any series of actions, or any one solitary action, that makes the target(s) feel intimidated. Continuing to use the example of John Doe, examples of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation </span><span class=\"c3\">include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_a3xgynthnks8-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Holding Jane Doe, John Doe&rsquo;s wife, hostage. The later section will highlight in greater detail ways to hold someone hostage. By sending a picture of Jane in a position of danger, John will feel intimidated, thus this is a successful instance of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Threatening to reveal the nature of John and Giles&rsquo; close relationship to Jane. Although Jane is no longer as infatuated as she used to be with John, this will still result in John feeling intimidated as he wonders how you gained this information, thus this is an example of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Leaving the remains of Jeremy at John&rsquo;s doorstep, ideally after 6:00 PM on a weekday, as if Jane were to see these remains when she returns home from work, she&rsquo;d dispose of them without any further questioning. This timing would be crucial to ensure that Jane does not interfere with the presence of Jeremy and that John will be able to see these remains. John will feel intimidated regardless, but it is also worth noting that this </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;attempt will be more effective if Jeremy&rsquo;s corpse is somehow preserved, so it is immediately apparent that the remains are that of Jeremy, and not any small rodent. </span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">2.3 Fear</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Ultimately, it is difficult to assuage whether an attempt of intimidation is successful without understanding the meaning of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>. This section will try to briefly establish the concept of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>, for the lucky few that are unfamiliar. Departing from the story of John Doe, some examples of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear </span><span class=\"c3\">include:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_g10crlnefzgn-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>You return to your childhood home that you have lived in since you were born for spring break. College was the first time you were ever away from home this long, and you hope that this break is as rejuvenating as fall break was. However, you find that your parents often forget your name, and it takes multiple attempts for you to get their attention. When you do have their attention, the only expression you ever see on their faces is a wide grin which takes care to only expose a modest amount of pearly white teeth. When you are not in their immediate line of sight, they stand motionless, the same expression on their face. Every night, when your mother tucks you into bed and kisses you on the forehead, her clenched teeth pressing against your skin, you may feel </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span>Everyday that your parents leave for work, you feel </span><span class=\"c5\">relief</span><span>. However, on a sunny Wednesday afternoon, when you wake up and go through the motions of your morning routine, you realize that there is now an extra door leading from your bedroom, matching exactly that of the bathroom door. When curiosity gets the better of you, and you enter this new bathroom, only to find yourself reentering your bedroom from the normal bathroom door, you feel </span><span class=\"c5\">perplexed</span><span>. Then, when this extra door is nowhere to be found, and the door behind you shuts and locks the moment you are no longer in the doorframe, you may feel </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">. </span></li><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">While you wander the unfamiliar new halls of your childhood home and your sense of time slips away, you notice how you don&rsquo;t recognize the smiling child in any of the childhood photographs your parents had so lovingly hung up throughout the house. The child&rsquo;s grin is far too wide, and despite you distinctly remembering having braces at that age, its teeth are pearly white. After descending the basement stairs to return to your bedroom on the second floor, you try the bathroom door once more to find it unlocked. As you reenter the bathroom, and look at yourself in the mirror. A wide grin can&rsquo;t help but stretch its way across your face with glee, as you have finally made it to the bathroom to begin your morning routine. The first step of your routine is to count the number of teeth you have. Identifying the emotion you feel as you do so is left as an exercise to the reader.</span></li></ol><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">3. The Strategy</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>Regarding RPS as purely a game of chance results in a game with little strategy to be had. However, understanding the many psychosocial dynamics that are at play in society are key to determining a winning strategy for RPS. These strategies usually require some amount of knowledge about the person you are competing against, such as knowledge of their </span><span class=\"c5\">associates</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;(defined above), however, a general strategy is also included in case this knowledge is for whatever reason unobtainable. This paper will not go into detail as to how to obtain such information.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c6\">3.1 A General Strategy</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">This strategy is to be used when very little information is known about your opponent, and it is difficult to procure any information. It will be assumed that the opponent is a blank slate.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Materials list:</span></p><ul class=\"c19 lst-kix_sbbmm0bc8uli-0 start\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">A weapon</span></li></ul><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Procedure:</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-0 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c9 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">There are two possible cases, depending on whether or not your opponent is capable of feeling emotion and pain:</span></li></ol><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-1 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c11 c16 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">If this is the case:</span></li></ol><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-2 start\" start=\"1\"><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">Boast about your flawless track record with games of RPS to your opponent. Regardless of whether this is true or not at the time of boasting, this raises the chances of instilling a sense of helplessness into your opponent. Otherwise, this has a chance of instilling a false sense of ease in your opponent if they assume that you are bluffing. Either result is advantageous.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span>Point your weapon towards the opponent. If your weapon of choice has high firepower or is a bludgeoning weapon, point this weapon towards this head, as in society, brain damage is undesirable, and the brain is located in the head. If your weapon deals damage by piercing or otherwise cutting into the flesh, hold your weapon at chest level, to maximize the amount of vulnerable locations you threaten to strike. Most people do not walk around in suits of armor. If for whatever reason, you do not have a weapon, any other form of </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;can be substituted here.</span></li><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span>Proclaim the </span><span>move</span><span>&nbsp;that you will make. Rock is recommended. If your opponent is exhibiting great amounts of </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span class=\"c3\">, it may prove further advantageous to instruct your opponent what move to make. Figure 1 (below) highlights what instruction to give your opponent depending on the move you claim you will make.</span></li></ol><a id=\"t.f4a7d4a41e0c028031ab9f3d5ee1244c1cc39ccf\"></a><a id=\"t.0\"></a><table class=\"c10 c24\"><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Your move</span></p></td><td class=\"c7\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Opponent&rsquo;s move</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Rock</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Scissors</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Paper</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Rock</span></p></td></tr><tr class=\"c4\"><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Scissors</span></p></td><td class=\"c14\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c3\">Paper</span></p></td></tr></table><p class=\"c8 c10\"><span class=\"c12\">Figure 1: Matchups in RPS that result in your victory</span></p><ol class=\"c19 lst-kix_mzz5rpqdttg5-2\" start=\"4\"><li class=\"c8 c10 c11 li-bullet-0\"><span class=\"c3\">Begin the countdown, and when it comes time to do so, make the move that you claimed you will make in step (iii).

In spite of this, this strategy is considered ideal because it avoids the risk of your opponent overpowering you when you </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidate</span><span>&nbsp;them, as advance preparation for your </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span>&nbsp;method ensures that your opponent will be overcome with </span><span class=\"c5\">fear</span><span>, and will also be powerless in undermining your </span><span class=\"c5\">intimidation</span><span class=\"c3\">&nbsp;at that immediate moment.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span>The overall strategy follows the same steps as in 3.1, replacing step (ii) with a different intimidation method, focusing on an </span><span class=\"c5\">associate</span><span>&nbsp;of your choice.

Surviving in the dog-eat-dog world of RPS is a matter of becoming the intimidator, as opposed to the intimidated (the eating dog, as opposed to the eaten dog, if you will). Ignoring this reality can be considered reflective of the losing attitude many hold towards life. However, nothing is truly up to the Great Random. Taking the weaknesses of your fellow man in mind, victory will not be clean, but it will be in your hands.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3\"></span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c3\">Further research is recommended in understanding how to guarantee victory against those without emotions or fear of mortality, such as against computers. Considering growing fears in society regarding a robot takeover, discovering a weakness of computers in the game of RPS can then be translated to strategies to prevent the computer uprising. If computers are truly made in our image, then they will fall the same way we do. Our human hands can only hope for perfection, but everything will fall short, even our treacherous machines.</span></p>",

    "title": "Scotty Dog Cheating, Martha Is Speechless!",
    "body": "Once again, the cheating allegations cannot escape Scotty Dog who was seen leaving Schenley Park with Clifford the Big Red Dog in photos posted to X and Reddit by Paparazzi. However it seems these allegations are not just allegations as videos were taken of Clifford kissing Scotty Dog. Scotty Dog’s reaction also seemed to prove his guilt with him barking and charging at the camera to stop them from recording. \r\n**MARTHA IS OUTRAGED**\r\nConcerned fans began to tag Martha Speaks, Scotty’s current girlfriend, on the situation on X which caused her to say in a tweet that she was taking a break from social media. However, it is certain it is due to not wanting to post a hasty tweet on the current (or perhaps recently ended) relationship between her and Scotty Dog. We at README got an interview with Martha and were able to get a few questions in before she walked out and accused the reporter for being a “wannabe TMZ loser for the elderly” and “a stalker who cares too much about the love lives of dogs”. That’s mean of Martha to say because README is a very credible source of information and the reporter is not obsessed with dog romance. \r\nTOTAL CONFESSION\r\nIn a recent tweet published on Scotty Dog’s private X account, a red heart was posted which basically confirms cheating allegations because Clifford is red. Using trash left outside of Clifford’s home which included black dog hairs, Turner’s lemonade bottles and plaid wrapping paper, we at README have deduced that those two are certainly engaged in a secret love affair. But what reason did Scotty Dog have for cheating beside being a playboy?\r\n**THE UGLY TRUTH ABOUT SCOTTY DOG**\r\n While Martha was known for her red collar, she had actually switched to blue in recent years. Many fans suspect that this sudden relationship with Clifford is a stunt to bring more students to CMU. When Scotty Dog was dating Martha students felt the mismatching colors were off-putting for the CMU brand. Prospective students also thought the same thing and instead chose colleges where the couples matched the color scheme of the school. While blue is a color in the tartan, red is the distinctive CMU merchandising color. Since Clifford is red and CMU is red, this is a great relationship for Scotty Dog to get more students. As we know, the only thing Scotty Dog loves more than bagpipes, kilts, and Snoop Dogg is branding. That and charging outrageous amounts of money for tuition. \r\n**FUTURE**\r\nIt seems Scotty Dog’s love life is still so turbulent. In other news the reporter is no longer allowed to go back to the neighborhood Clifford lives in due to the neighborhood watch not appreciating investigative journalism. If you have any update PLEASE CONTACT README I’M BEGGING YOU. Go Tartans!",

    "title": "The Scramble for Element 119: The Race Continues",
    "body": "The quest to discover new superheavy elements has in the past been analogized to a race. Since the discovery of berkelium, in 1946, scientists from various laboratories around the world have competed, and at times collaborated, to discover new elements, leading to a string of discoveries of element 97 up to element 118. This race, however, has slowed to a halt after the most recent discovery, element 117, tennessine, in 2009. In 2017, the director of Riken, Dr. Hideto En’yo, not only announced that the search for element 119 had begun, but that elements 119 and 120 would be discovered within 5 years.\r\nDear reader, if you are capable of performing basic arithmetic mathematics, which I believe you are capable of since you are a university student, you might notice that 5 years after 2017 is the year 2022. Also, if you the reader have checked the date recently, you may notice that we are currently in the year 2024. That is, in fact, 2 years after 2022. Clearly, the current approach to discovering new elements isn’t working, and Dr. Hideto En’yo has been lying to us all.\r\nNow, dear reader, you might be wondering what exactly is the process of discovering new elements. In a nutshell (not literally), researchers take one heavy element, such as berkelium, and then accelerate particles of another element, such as calcium, to bombard the first heavy element (this was how tennessine was discovered). With enough tries, and luck, this might lead to the creation of a new element. Sounds simple enough, right? At this point, dear reader, you might be wondering how exactly they accelerate these particles. Magnets are used to both steer the particles in a circular trajectory and accelerate them up to speed. Herein lies the problem. Magnets? What do you mean they use magnets to accelerate particles? By magnets, you mean those things people put on their refrigerators? Like fridge magnets? This was never going to work, they have played us for absolute fools, managing to convince us, the common person, to put our faith in them. Obviously, this method would never work, and the particle physicists of our time do not know what they’re doing.\r\nIs all hope lost? Will we never discover element 119? Fortunately, I have not just brought to you, the reader, the problem, but also the solution to this very problem. If magnets can’t accelerate particles up to speed, what can? Evidently, a lot of things (try lifting the weights in the Cohon Fitness Center using fridge magnets, then lift that weight yourself). The best candidate for a viable method, however, are track athletes. Imagine for a moment two athletes, one holding a particle of einsteinium, element 99, and a particle of calcium, then have these two athletes sprint into each other at full speed. Not only would this finally allow the particles to move at sufficient speed, but it would ensure that the particles actually collide with each other, as two athletes colliding is much more probable than hoping two unimaginably tiny particles can be steered into each other using magnets.\r\nDear reader, we have plotted our course for the future. I have already sent my proposal to all of the scientists currently working on discovering element 119 (my editor has informed me that I have left out one scientist in particular, but I swear that was an accident). Dear reader, if you begin training now, you might just be able to become one of the athletes involved in the groundbreaking discovery of element 119. Another benefit that hasn’t yet been mentioned is that most likely, the new element would be named after an athlete, someone people care about, instead of some lousy so-called scientist. This of course means that if you train enough, you might be said athlete and receive naming rights. For reference, you would have to be able to run at speeds of 30 million meters per second, which admittedly is difficult but is fully within the realms of human possibility. Good luck, dear reader, and see you on the periodic table.",

    "title": "CS Students to be Decimated, Roman Legion-style",
    "body": "Early this week, SCS students would have been informed via email that a tenth of the SCS student are to be culled, and the email would have included details on how which students are selected to be put to death. Any SCS students who have not seen such an email are asked to urgently check their spam folder. The decimation of SCS, as a direct order from our Dark Lord Biden, is likely to commence before the next United States president-elect gets sworn into office on January 25. All SCS students are thus currently forbidden from leaving the country.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming Roman-legion-style decimation of an entire CMU college is a drastic measure following a ban on C, the programming language, and all of its variants, beginning this summer. Given this fact, the future massacre should not come as a surprise to most SCS students as many computer science courses at CMU still stubbornly refuse to adapt their syllabus to use a different programming language. Such flagrant defiance against law and order would not go unpunished by the government of this great nation, and killing one-tenth of all CS students at CMU was deemed an appropriate measure by President Biden, further stating in a recent press release that “[CS students] should be thankful that I am only executing ten-percent of them, I could just as easily personally kill all of them if I wanted to”.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that given the proximity of their major to CS, some ECE students might be included in the pool of execution candidates; ECE software majors, your days may be numbered—and not in the countably infinite sense.\r\n\r\nVarious students from different majors at CMU have expressed solidarity with the CS students, sympathizing with them for their predicament. Several creative writing major students have reached out to us for comment, saying that “it would be very difficult to write without the letter C.” Similarly, an underwater basketweaving major (yes this is a real major at CMU look it up) student commented expressed concerns towards the ban and punishment, “banning the sea? What do you mean? I need the sea, it’s my entire livelihood!”\r\n\r\nThere have been some immediate consequences from this ordeal. The CS department began drafting plans to replace C with Rust to prevent further unnecessary deaths. Opponents of this proposal argue that Rust is an unsuitable substitute because it “ruins metals” and “advances the trans agenda.”\r\n\r\nOne unforeseen consequence of this ordeal has been an uptick in petty crimes committed on CMU campus: the rate of littering has skyrocketed in a desperate bid by international students trying to be deported back to the safety of their home countries, narrowly avoiding the ten-percent chance of death.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime of waiting for their eventual deaths, students enrolled in SCS may be pleased to know that they are temporarily safe from death as although our Lord Joe Biden’s orders are absolute, there have been complications in enacting the punishment. The decision to kill 10% of SCS students may be straightforward, but the execution itself would require the representation of 0.1 in binary. Thus, the decimation will be indefinitely postponed until a computer capable of storing a string of binary digits with infinite length is developed.",

    "title": "CMU To Construct New, Shittier Donner",
    "body": "With the completion of the new Highmark Center for Wellness, CMU has successfully wrapped up yet another construction project. Needing a new project to collect alumni donations, CMU turns to their freshman housing. Hopeful Donner residents prayed that CMU would finally announce the destruction of Donner, however, this Monday CMU announced that it will begin construction on a new, shittier Donner. The new Donner, aptly named Downer will be constructed directly next to the current Donner, so Donner residents are reminded that it could always get worse. \r\n\r\nA competition was hosted among the architecture students to design a building just inhabitable enough to be zoned under student housing. Students were given 24 hours and unlimited cans of red bull. Current junior Eshaan Joshi’s design was selected. The building will have 9 total floors, 4 of which are sub-basements, each floor to represent one circle of hell. \r\n\r\nTo prevent constant flooding only the first floor will have bathrooms and water fountains. The space saved by having bathrooms on each floor will house amenities for the residents. The second floor will contain a practice space for Kiltie band, and the fourth floor will contain a completely blacked out study space for students taking 15-122. The third sub-basement will contain a game room featuring a ping pong table missing the net, a pool table, and random assortment of pool balls, and a vending machine that is never restocked. Each room will be just large enough to be feasible for a forced triple. Students who discover roaches in their room will be billed an extra $150 for housing extra tenets. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the construction of Highmark was $5 million over budget, so some expenses need to be cut in the construction of Downer. Thankfully CMU students already enjoy constructing buildings for booth, so this year's carnival theme will be the construction of Downer. Students will build the foundations of this new building over the weeklong period, and then CMU will hire a construction crew to finish the rest. The 4 students in civil engineering will be tasked with leading this project, while current architecture students have shifted their studio focus to building popsicle stick dioramas of the new building. This new building will not feature air conditioning or heating, to further cut back on costs. Downer will contain washing machines, but dryers are predicted to be added by 2030, to help spread out the cost.\r\n\r\nMany alumni are very excited about this project, especially those who lived in Donner, as they can now say they weren't assigned the shittiest housing on campus. Famous alum, David Tepper, has even agreed to donate a rotting whale carcass to serve as the new house’s mascot.",

    "title": "README Strike Thwarted By Too Many Supporters",
    "body": "The sun was shining as a group of README writers took their places along the sidewalk of Forbes Avenue. Pushing aside Jehovah’s Witnesses, the group raised their signs and began to chant: “Eshaan works us ‘till we’re dust, and he won’t fucking pay us”. Weeks of worker tensions had finally boiled over into an all-out README strike, and Carnegie Mellon’s most middlingly competent authors were taking to the streets in protest. \r\n\r\nAs the strike went on, Eshaan Joshi was seemingly unperturbed by the calls for his beheading. Sitting on his throne of solid gold README copies, he wore a crisp pinstripe suit and held a cane adorned with a bloodied pen. Upon his lap was a snow white cat which he stroked, not noticing the white fur slowly covering his lap. When asked about the strike Joshi shrugged, stating that he would “rather cut off both his arms than negotiate with those peasants.” Yet despite his confidence in the gullibility of CMU’s student body, the pitch meeting remained empty, minus a freshman who mistakenly thought it was TA office hours for Reasoning with Data. Slowly Joshi realized he would be forced to negotiate with the striking writers. “Fine,” he huffed, rising from his throne. “I’ll do it their way.”\r\n\r\nTensions were high as Joshi approached the picket line. Several demonstrators began sharpening a guillotine that had seemingly been constructed next to Walking to the Sky. “Relax” Joshi called out, “I’m not here to fire you all, I promise.” The strikers remained silent, pausing their chanting to see what their Editor-in-Chief would do next. “I’m actually here to help you guys! I’m joining the strike!” Joshi continued. “I’m all for worker rights or whatever you want.” Gasps rippled through the crowd. Several strike leaders gathered around, muttering amongst themselves and eyeing Joshi suspiciously. After careful deliberation Tali Kirschenbaum, head editor for README, carefully held out a sign for Joshi to take. Unfortunately for Kirschenbaum, she had failed to realize that there were exactly twenty-four writers on strike, and under the new CMU policy Eshaan would become the dreaded twenty-fifth demonstrator. The strike could now be classified as a disruptive political protest, and as such Carnegie Mellon had the right to crush the peaceful demonstrators using any force necessary. \r\n\r\nAs soon as Joshi picked up a sign, police clad in tactical riot gear swarmed down on the protestors from nearby bushes. The leader, holding a megaphone, commanded the students to surrender. “THIS IS AN UNLAWFUL GATHERING OF TWENTY-FIVE PEOPLE, PLACE YOUR HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEAD AND GET ON THE GROUND!” Before the bewildered README staff could react, canisters of tear gas were fired into the crowd. Screams could be heard all the way to Hamerschlag, and when the cloud of smoke finally lifted all twenty-four writers were bloody and bruised. Policemen lined up the protestors and blindfolded them as Joshi watched from the shadows, having slipped away in the chaos. Up in his office atop Warner Hall, Farnam Jahanian watched from the window. Officers began to raise their guns as Jahanian raised a radio to his lips. “Fire.” Shots rang out as the staff of README fell down, dead.\r\n\r\nIf you or a friend would like to join README, every single position is currently open! Please contact us today!",

    "body": "Texas Instruments Incorporated. Beloved creator of worldwide-use calculators, fine electrical equipment, and high explosives. \r\n\r\nIn this week that will forever go down in history, TI merged its fields of expertise into one product to blow them all away: The TI-C4s, a new line of explosive-rigged calculators. And CMU – the unique, insane school it is – has turned their plot completely on its head.\r\n\r\n\tTexas Instruments professed just one reason for their calculators to completely stop their modification. TI calculators have long had a dedicated, passionate fanbase of programmers and hackers, modding and sharing detailed games and elaborate projects the world over. And TI hates them. Despises them. In a recent  press release, representatives of the corporation — bombarded with incensed outcries and comparisons to the Desmos software’s community scene — said a total of eleven words before having to leave the room to calm down. On the personal and corporate level, TI wants its hackers gone.. \r\n\r\n\tWe should have seen TI’s more drastic measures coming a long, long time ago. True fans of the company recognize, or even remember if particularly lucky, their work on the elaborate BOLT-117 laser-guided missile. Widely regarded as a gorgeous piece of engineering, TI opened the industry of building hyper-capable electronics into massive dumb bombs. If only they had a modern product of hyper-capable electronics to stuff with dumb bombs.\r\n\r\n\tUnder this proud banner was the TI-C4 released. Identical to a TI-84 Plus CE – if one ignores its seven-segment countdown panel and several extra pounds – it has become TI’s new flagship product overnight. Nothing better represents their modern poison-dart-frog-esque sentiment: if you don’t mess with the calculator in any capacity, the calculator will not disassemble your anatomy to any degree.\r\n\r\nCMU students have taken up the challenge. We’ve reached out to a newborn student organization at CMU – lovingly named We Don’t Blow **** Up Committee — to see what CMU is doing about the latest threat to students having a good time. Founded last Tuesday by two CMU Esports Platinum CS:GO players who earned “Most Enthusiastic Counter-Terrorist” several years running, WDB*UC has burgeoned overnight into a training camp for amateur bomb defusal specialists. They’ve bulk ordered hundreds of TI-C4s, enduring countless cease-and-desists from the mailing room, to fund their operation; and shared why they turned their passions towards these new products.\r\n\r\n“Well, firstly, spite,” said one. “Good and pure rage. Everyone’s now got a bone to pick with TI over them being little cowards. Surely one of them is a cybersecurity guy, and we can share if not.” \r\n\r\n“And on a more serious note,” answered the other, “they’re a perfect dual playing ground. You can work from afar, breaking in through software and trying not to trigger the automatic anti-modification detectors, or you can go in by hand and work on the electronics up close. We’ve never been able to get this many CS and ECE students in a room without critical mass burning down the school. Things are looking good for us.”\r\n\r\nThe WDB*UC is indeed seeing wide, wide success. It’s attracted CMU’s elusive drama and creative writing students as rapt spectators to the tense defusing rooms. It’s provided free bombless calculators to two high schools in the Pittsburgh area, and free calculatorless bombs to other unnamed grateful parties. And it’s witnessed yet another TI executive tragically pass away from a stress aneurysm — whether simple coincidence, or a successful push against injustice, I’m not at license to say.",

To be invited, simply bring a copy of this week’s Readme issue with you and show it to our bouncer. “What about IDs? Won’t we need to show you our IDs? I went through the trouble of making fake IDs in preparation for college life all for nothing?”, my overactive imagination envisions you, the reader, thinking. Obviously, we won't serve alcohol to partygoers if we see their IDs stating that they are underage.\r\nBefore giving more details about the party, I, as one of the writers at Readme, would like to reaffirm Readme’s core values and commitment to maintaining those values and high standards of conduct among our staff. Readme is dedicated to providing the facts, and only the facts, to the diverse student body of Carnegie Mellon University. We also pride ourselves on providing an example of how students ought to behave, not just as University students, but as moral, well-functioning adults, so readers may strive to become productive members of society. It is for all these reasons that Readme will continue to adhere strictly to the just laws of this great nation and state. The federal minimum drinking age in the US is 21; just as in past parties, if we see the IDs of anyone at the drinks table that states that they are under 21, we will peacefully (then forcefully if required) turn the student away from the drinks table, and remove them from the party altogether. To prevent this student from re-attempting to drink despite being underage, we will also forward the student’s name along with a picture of their photo ID to other student organizations whom we keep contact with, in case the student tries to drink at any of those organizations’ parties.\r\nWith all this being said, Readme would like to announce our updated ID policy for this Friday’s party: we will not ask to look at your ID. It’s quite simple, see: if we do not see that your ID states that you are under 21, we won’t know that you are underage and therefore have no obligation to prevent you from drinking. In fact, if you for whatever reason as an underage person decide to shove your ID into the face of our bouncers so we are forced to look at your IDs, we will simply pretend to be extremely nearsighted or illiterate.\r\nWe look forward to all the students who will show up for a night of decadence and debauchery.

We had the element of surprise.\r\nTwelve twenty­five p.m.\r\nPresident Jahanian, standing in\r\nNapoleonic fashion behind the frontline that had assembled atop Warner Hall, let his arm drop and gave the order. “Fire!”\r\nFour explosions, and four westbound cannonballs fired from Carnegie Mellon’s most archaic weapons, filled the air. Three made contact with the target, while one fell below the skyline, towards the streetscape, to wreak what minimal damage it could.\r\nThree shattered windows were visible against the silhouette of the Cathedral of Learning, with smoke billowing up out of the broken top. With Cathy out of commission, Carnegie Mellon was the grandest institution in Pittsburgh, but he didn’t have much time to admire his handiwork.\r\nHe donned his Napoleonic bowl cap. “Troops, advance!”\r\nThe chemistry majors tore down Forbes Avenue in pickup trucks, with vials of phosgene that they were ready to shatter once past Schenley Plaza. The physics majors set up their catapults, ready to bombard their western brethren with a deadly combination of textbooks and lab notebooks. The CS majors were sent to plant the virus they’d created on every piece of technology on campus; the biology majors went to sprinkle the virus they’d created onto the plates at every dining hall in the West. The ML majors were sent to figure out the optimal way to annex territory, bit by bit. And the Tepper students were sent in to negotiate a peace once victory was won, with the polisci majors sent in as backup once they failed.",

    "body": "As the laser cannon atop the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning nears completion, projected for the fall 2024 semester, Pitt students rejoice their opportunity to reenter the locked top floors of Cathy to zap unsuspecting CMU students. A Pitt alumn elaborated in an interview, “I always loved studying up there. The fear of death that comes from doing multidimensional calculus at that height—gusts of wind blowing your notes around, the ledge so perilously close to your study nook, pset deadline three minutes away and ticking down fast—it was really just an immense boost to my productivity. I haven’t been able to focus so well since I was an undergrad. But now I can visit my alma mater, finally get some work done, and zap some pretentious CMU students all in the same visit? I wouldn’t pass it up for the world.”\r\n\r\nLuckily for us, a recent email from the War Director at CMU states that Carnegie Mellon’s new Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics, replacing the now-demolished Skibo Gym, is on schedule to provide necessary shelter in the form of yet another turtle on campus. \r\n\r\n{{gates_turtle.png}}\r\n\r\nAs we all know, turtles have hard shells on their backs. Additionally, arbitrary cross sections of turtles' shells are smooth concave surfaces, and as such are suitable for deflecting lasers (see helpful graphic). The Director assures that the combined coverage of Wean, Gates, and the new Highmark Center will give CMU ample cover to remain safe under the watchful eye of Upitt's laser cannons constructing on top of the Cathedral.\r\n\r\n{{helpful_graphic.png}}",

    "body": "Wean Hall needs no introduction. As the sole brutalist structure on campus, its stark concrete facade gives an intimidating visage to the campus's hub for science and engineering. Many are vaguely aware of Raymond J Wean, founder of Wean Incorporated, and the namesake of Wean Hall, immortalized in a plaque on the wall of La Prima.\r\n\r\nHowever, upon googling Raymond J Wean, one CMU official made a shocking discovery: Wean lived a double life, as a brutal enforcer for the Bonanno crime family. According to Wean's assigned FBI agent, \"Wean was a psychopath. He would have killed you and not batted an eye.\" Wean once testified in court that he committed \"roughly 200 crimes\", despite never fully joining the ranks of the infamous crime family.\r\n\r\nWean Hall's namesake may come back to haunt it. Wean Hall is currently gaining in the polls as an independent candidate in the 2024 presidential election, but its progress has faltered since the news broke, despite an increase in campaign spending and the mysterious death of several of its rivals.",

    "body": "It is clear that CMU students are overwhelmed by unnecessary, unrealistic, unfathomable, unfashionable amounts of schoolwork assigned to them every day. A new policy has just entered into testing by the lab of Dr. Et Al, and has shown remarkable results in regards to student-professor relations. \r\n\r\nThis policy grants students the ability to assign an unrestricted amount of work to any professor at CMU, or in the state of Pennsylvania. This levels out the playing field by ensuring that professors can relate directly to the everyday struggle of students as they engage in the unending slog of CMU coursework. This practice will ensure that the bond between students and their instructors is tighter than previously seen, and as a labor history professor put it, “we are united in toil.”\r\n\r\n“Since the policy has entered into testing, I've assigned four different professors a compendium of League Of Legends Mechanics and Strategy guides. For the final this weekend we will be queuing as a 5-stack” \r\nRyan Chernoff, a School of Computer Science student at 5124 Margaret Morrison St, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 who asked to remain “anonymous”, but to that we respond, “hi anonymous i’m dad”\r\n\r\n“It is so nice to be the one producing mediocre work instead of lazily skimming over students' work and rolling a 5d20 to determine their grade—as I have been doing for the past 17 years.”\r\nA CMU professor who works at CMU who asked for their CMU affiliation with CMU to remain anonymous\r\n\r\n“Fuck th*s shit, this is why I want to do research only.”\r\nDr. Et Al, the professor who is leading this very study",

    "title": "Rightward Shift in Optimal Arousal Level to Maximize Productivity",
    "body": "From the enclosure movement in 18th century England, the owning class has been tasked with answering how to maximize the productivity of their peons. As the modern American university becomes increasingly corporate and a profit-seeking endeavor, similar questions are now being asked by university administrators. Many things have been tried in the past- lashings, paternalistic brainwashing, foremen - which are certainly things university administrators should try, but may not be the most effective. This project found that the answer lies in the Yerkes-Dodson law, not external disincentives. The Yerkes Dodson law is a psychological theory stating that humans are most productive at their given “optimal arousal state” - i.e. a mental state somewhere between underwhelmed and overwhelmed. By shifting this state rightwards, students will be able to undertake more stress and therefore be more productive than they currently are under present CMU workloads. While this study did not manage to discover a method for causing this rightward shift, we identify the need for such by comparing the effectiveness of other productivity-increasing methods in past literature.",
