I\r\ndirect you to my official Dietrich\r\nmerch, reading “My major may not\r\nmake money, but is too impractical to\r\nbe recruited into the military-industrial complex.”\r\n\r\n{{too_impractical.png}}\r\n\r\n# Has Anyone REALLY Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?\r\nWhy do they call it a question\r\nwhen you quest in the cold inquiries\r\nquest out hot eat the inquiries?\r\n\r\n# what's the most efficient way to navigate the store to purchase groceries?\r\nThis reads suspiciously like a\r\n15122 assignment and as we all\r\nknow, the geese report back to Honk\r\nand Chonk, who reports back to\r\nIliano. The geese are everywhere.\r\nI’m not in the business of getting hit\r\nby AIVs before stepping foot in a CS\r\nclass. Next question!\r\n\r\n# I want to start a new hobby, what hobbies are good?\r\nYeah, so speaking of CS majors.\r\nWhy don’t you mallocate some time\r\naway from labs and try out:\r\nOperating a business without\r\nregistering with the Pennsylvania\r\nDepartment of Revenue?\r\nPayment of cash wages to\r\nemployees for the purpose of\r\navoiding Pennsylvania Withholding\r\nTax?\r\nAvoiding the Excise Tax on diesel\r\nfuel by using \"Off Road Diesel\" in\r\nthe fuel supply tanks of a motor\r\nvehicle for use on highways?\r\nOverstating the number of\r\nchildren or other dependents on an\r\nindividual income tax return?\r\n\r\n# what is the best activity to do with someone you don’t know well but are trying to get to know better?\r\nLet’s just say that should you\r\nfollow my advice in the last portion\r\nwith an acquaintance, and things\r\nwere to somehow go wrong (not that\r\nI would be held legally responsible,\r\nof course), there’s this really well\r\nstudied game called the Prisoner’s\r\nDilemma that will tell you a whole\r\nlot about a person really quickly. And\r\npotentially give you a whole lot of\r\ntime to yourself to ponder what you\r\nlearn about them.\r\n\r\n# what should be next on my reading list?\r\nhttps://libraryofbabel.info/\r\nThis has it all. What was in that\r\nskin bound book you stole from that\r\nweird crypt thing in Wean 2 last\r\nMonday? Who are the people in dark\r\ncloaks following you around? If you\r\nhypothetically had to hide from dark,\r\nshadowy, eldritch forces, how secure\r\nwould the CMU sewers be in terms\r\nof hiding places? How do you\r\nbarricade a door? If you get killed\r\nby eldritch monsters, do you have to\r\nlet your readme editor know you’re\r\nmissing an issue in advance?\r\nFor completely unrelated reasons,\r\nthat’ll be all for this week!",

Am I gripping too hard? Is it too late to switch the eye I'm making eye contact with right now?\r\nIdeally, a nice firm handshake\r\nshould last until either your hand is\r\nhonorably broken or you honorably\r\nbreak your opponent’s hand. As we\r\nall know, social interaction is a zero\r\nsum game and someone must win.\r\nConsequently, there’s no such thing\r\nas gripping too hard– your grip\r\nshould ideally be on the stronger end\r\nof “limp fish” to “forbidden by the\r\nGeneva Conventions oh god why do\r\nyou have a three pointed knife\r\nconcealed in your palm.” Switch\r\nwhich eye you make eye contact with\r\nas often as you like–even if you lose\r\nthe handshake portion of the game,\r\nyou can get half points by winning\r\nthe staring contest bit.\r\n\r\n_-With help from Dr. Et. Al_\r\n\r\n# What does it mean if someone who never uses punctuation or capital letters in texts sends me a text that begins with a capital letter? (they didn’t use a period or anything, which would unambiguously mean they hate me, but im still worried)\r\nAs you said, this one is a bit more\r\nambiguous than using a period. It is,\r\nhowever, not so ambiguous that we\r\ncan’t flowchart it out!\r\n\r\n{{flow1.png}}\r\n\r\n_- With help from Dr. Et. Al_\r\n\r\n# do you think if i got a concussion and i couldn’t make excellent points about the role of the social contract in french salon art my art teacher would still love me\r\nThis one’s for your art teacher,\r\nactually, I’m going to need you to\r\navert your eyes and convalesce in a\r\nSwiss sanitarium with leeches for a\r\nfew seconds\r\n\r\n{{flow2.png}}\r\n\r\nOkay, you can look now.\r\n\r\n_- With help from Dr. Et. Al_\r\n\r\n# Is my incessant allergy based sneezing getting on the nerves of my lab partner?\r\nDepending on what kind of lab\r\nyou’re in, it’s probably more just\r\nconcerning. For example, what are\r\nyou doing sneezing in a physics lab?\r\nWhat are you, allergic to the\r\nfundamental particles of reality and\r\nthe strong force as a whole? Or what\r\nare you doing sneezing in a forensics\r\nlab? Cocaine?\r\n\r\n# Is the sneezing allergy based or do I just want to assume that?\r\nIf you’re sneezing in an\r\nepidemiology lab, I also just want to\r\nassume that it’s allergy based!\r\n\r\n# how do I tell if people close to me are in a relationship?\r\nIf one of them reads this\r\ngodforsaken column and applies all\r\nof its advice on the other person,\r\nand the other person still chooses to\r\nassociate with the advice column\r\nreader, that’s either true love or\r\ninsanity. Which is still kind of a coin\r\nflip, but seems better than what\r\nyou’re currently working with.\r\n\r\n_- With help from [Author Who Asked To Be Credited Only As ‘He Who Shall Not Be Named II’, who has been summarily shot for lack of faith in this column and, by extension, ReadMe]_\r\n\r\n# † Have you considered getting\r\nevaluated for anxiety?\r\nThis is my advice column, not yours.",
