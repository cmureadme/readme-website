Please follow the style guide in our pinned repo. 
Make sure that you are on the dev branch when making changes.

# File System
Most of our html and css files are named the same things so it should be pretty obvious what is paired with what.
All html files (except for base) should be in the templates\articles folder.
All css files should be in the styles folder.

## base.html and base.css
These files are the styling for the header this is at the top of nearly every page. 
Every other html file extends base, or a html file that extends base (denoted by {% extends "base.html" %} at the top of the file).
The styling in bass.css is the defalt styling applied to all pages.

## index.html and index.css
These files are for the front page of the website.

## about_us.html and about_us.css
The about us page.

## article_card.html and article_card.css
Used whenever a long list of articles are displayed on screen.
This should never have extends base.html at the top, instead this html page is included in other html pages.
Because this page is always included in other pages, the page that incudes this must have in its head include article_card.css (do not include the css in the html file as then on every call to this file (which is a lot) it has to also load the css, this is slow and bad practice).

## article_page.html and article_page.css
Actual page of an article.

## author_list.html and author_list.css
List of all the authors.
This is what you see when you click the staff tab.
Note that all staff are refered to as authors by our codebase.

## author.html and author.css
Page for a singluar staffmember.

## category.html
