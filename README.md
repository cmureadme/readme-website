# Readme Website
Welcome to <strike>hell</strike> the Readme Website!
This repo is not forked off of [the old website repo](https://github.com/cmureadme/readme-website-old) but many of the files have been copied over.
This new repo is not cursed and was made to fix a lot of the issues present in the old repo.
The two main changes between the old repo and this new repo is that the app `articles` is now called `magazine`.
The database schemas are very simular but they are not the same.
The old database will not work with this new repo and you will not be able to develop for this repo if you only have a copy of the old database.

# Things you are not allowed to commit to this repo:
- media (outside of the things in the `static` folder)
- databases
- secret keys

Please make all of your changes on DEV and then pull request them to main :)
