        Hey, we're readme, an up-and-coming comedy and satire publication here at Carnegie Mellon University. 
        We're run by a gang of hooligans, idiots, and the occasional actual comedian, and we were hoping you'd find it in your heart do donate to us. 
        Readme is a shoestring operation, and we run this entire thing on a combination of student print quota, campus printing, and around $75 an issue to write, edit, print, and distribute across campus. 
        Even a couple of dollars makes a huge difference, and we'd love to have your support in keeping CMU students well entertained.
        <br>
        Best,
        <br>
        Eshaan Joshi, Editor-in-Chief
